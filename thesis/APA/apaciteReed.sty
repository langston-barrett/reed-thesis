  % A cedilla accent (\c{c}) in an author name used to lead
  % to errors, only due to the checking whether subsequent authors
  % in the same citation are equivalent. The same problem is
  % anticipated with the \b{...} accent and the \d{...} accent
  % and the \copyright symbol (will the latter turn up in an
  % author name?), due to the same use of \crcr, cf. The TeXbook, p. 356.
  %
  % This fix therefore redefines these to sensible alternatives,
  % only for comparison of authors, not for any real formatting.
  % Therefore, the user should not notice this, apart from the
  % lack of errors, of course. Therefore, it is also a default
  % option. However, because I haven't tested this thoroughly, I give
  % the user the option to turn it off (noaccentfix). The user
  % is then responsible for fixing any error messages generated
