\chapter*{Abstract}

In this thesis we explain Univalent type theory, a constructive and
computationally meaningful foundational system for mathematics inspired by
recent advances in the model theory of Per Martin-L\"of's intuitionistic type
theory. We first develop the classical propositions/types correspondence between
(the constructive subset of) intuitionistic natural dedication and the
Î»-calculus. We proceed to explicate Martin-L\"of's theory of dependent types and
the central modern development in type theory: Vladimir Voevodsky's Univalence
principle. We go on to examine some category theory and the nature of coinduction
within this theory, presenting a novel formalization of a recent result that
M-types can be derived \textit{internally} in Univalent type theory.
