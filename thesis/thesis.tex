\chapter*{Abstract}

In this thesis, we explain Univalent type theory, a constructive and
computationally meaningful foundational system for mathematics inspired by
recent advances in the semantics of Per Martin-L\"of's intentional type theory.
We first develop the classical Curry-Howard correspondence between (the
constructive subset of) Gentzen's natural deducation and the $\lambda$-calculus.
We proceed to explicate Martin-L\"of's theory of dependent types and the central
modern development in type theory: Vladimir Voevodsky's Univalence principle. 
We go on to examine the nature of coinduction within this theory, presenting a
novel formalization of a recent result that M-types can be derived
\textit{internally} in Univalent type theory.

\section*{A short history of discomfort in mathematics}

% \subsection*{Trouble in Cantor's Paradise}

In the early 20\textsuperscript{th} century, mathematicians had a problem. Often
held up as the pinnacle of necessary, undoubtable, \textit{a priori} truth,
their discipline was suffering from an embarrassing lack of certainty. The
intricate arguments of advanced analysis left mathematicians unable to confirm
nor deny each other's proofs. While Cantor's na\"ive set theory had unleashed a
wave of paradoxes, the need for a rigorous logical foundation for higher
mathematics was so great that the enterprise of axiomatic set theory was pursued
headlong until some kind of consensus was reached. To make a long, rich story
brutally short, virtually every modern paper in mathematics and computer
science uses a combination of Gentzen's first-order logic (\abbreviation{FOL})
and an axiomatization of sets called
\abbreviation{ZFC}.\footnote{This ``consensus'' left out many
  prominent schools of thought, such as the Intuitionists and constructivists, a
  point we'll soon return to.} 

Despite the apparent rigor of \abbreviation{FOL}+\abbreviation{ZFC},
practitioners of the deductive sciences were still beset by issues of
verifiability. Complexity, specialization and sheer length made modern proofs
difficult to comprehend with the absolute certainty which is supposed to
characterize these disciplines. In the 1970s, two teams of topologists proved
contradictory results, and neither group could find the error in the other's
proof \cite{kolata}. Wiles's famous proof of Fermat's last theorem was utterly
unintelligible to the vast majority of mathematicians \cite{nyt}. The
classification of the simple finite groups, one of the crowning achievements of
modern mathematics, has a combined proof of over ten thousand pages. These
examples illustrate merely a few of the practical epistemological challenges
facing mathematicians, for a historical perspective see \cite{rigor-and-proof},
and for a general overview see \cite{fidelity}.

In 1990s, Fields medalist Vladimir Voevodsky grew concerned with the state
of mathematical knowledge. In 1998, Carlos Simpson released a pre-print arguing
that there was a major mistake in one of Voevodsky's papers. However, it was not
clear whether Voevodsky had errored, or whether there was a flaw in Simpson's
counterexample. In 1999, Pierre Deligne found a crucial mistake in Voevodsky's
``Cohomological Theory of Presheaves with Transfers'', upon which he had based
much of his work in the area of motivic cohomology. As he began to develop more
and more complex arguments, Voevodsky wondered: ``And who would ensure that I
did not forget something and did not make a mistake, if even the mistakes in
much more simple arguments take years to uncover?'' \cite{voevodsky-ias}. 

The problems facing Voevodsky and his peers seemed insurmountable.
As the requisite attention span, memory, and capacity for detail required to
understand new developments in higer mathematics reached inhuman proportions,
where was he to turn? He would not find a solution in the realm of pure
mathematics, but rather in one of the finest examples of collaboration between
mathematicians, computer scientists, and philosophers: the modern proof
assistant. \TODO{reword}

\section*{TODO}

While much of the mathematical discipline was simply relieved to have ``solved''
their foundational issues with axiomatic set theory, there remained a vocal
opposition to the newly-adopted methods. Most mathematicians are dimly aware
that there's some controversy about the Axiom of Choice (the ``C'' in
\abbreviation{ZFC}) \cite{martin-lof-100-years}, you don't have to look further
than \abbreviation{FOL} to find disagreements.

\subsubsection{On the law of the excluded middle}
\label{subsec:on-the-law-of-the-excluded-middle}

\TODO{introduce the topic based on previous sections}

Consider functions with the following types:
\begin{itemize}
  \itemsep0em
  \item $\texttt{dne}:\prod_{A:\caU}(A\to\bot\to\bot)\to A$
  \item $\texttt{lem}:\prod_{A:\caU}A+(A\to\bot)$
\end{itemize}
What can we tell about these functions from their type signatures?
The term \texttt{dne} takes as argument a term $x:A\to\bot\to\bot$,
that is, a term showing that $A$ is not the empty type\footnote{More precisely,
  $x$ demonstrates that $A$ is not \textit{isomorphic} or \textit{equivalent} to
  $\bot$, in the sense of \cref{subsec:weak-equivalences}. If $A$ were isomorphic
  to $\bot$, then that isomorphism would be an inhabitant of $A\to\bot$.}, and
produces some element of $A$. This seems like a very tricky function to write:
how can we give a term of type $A$ just by knowing $A$ has terms? We don't
know what form data of type $A$ have! The function $\texttt{lem}$ seems
similarly quagmired. Given a type $A$, this function either has to produce an
element of it, or demonstrate that it is uninhabited. 

As you may have already guessed, under the Curry-Howard correspondence, these
functions correspond to the rule of double negation elimination
(\texttt{dne})\index{Double negation elimination}
and the law of excluded middle (\texttt{lem})\index{Law of excluded middle}:

\begin{minipage}[b]{0.50\linewidth}
  \centering
  \begin{displaymath}
    \prftree[r]{\footnotesize DNE}
      {P\prop}{\lnot \lnot P\true}
      {P\true}

      {P\prop}
      {P\lor\lnot P\true}
  \end{displaymath}
\end{minipage}
\vspace{-0.3em}

\noindent These are logically equivalent. To demonstrate with finality that
these are not definable terms in any consistent type theory, consider the
application of \texttt{lem} to a type \texttt{pnp} that corresponds to the
$\textsc{P}\neq\textsc{NP}$ conjecture under the types-as-propositions
interpretation. If \texttt{lem} existed, we could trivially solve this problem
and make a million dollars! We need no recourse to philosophy to justify the
constructive/intuitionistic logic of proof assistants: nothing else computes.

\chapter{Category theory}
\label{chap:category-theory}

Category theory presents a challange to set-theoretic mathematicians: the
canonical example of a category is $\Set$, the collection of all sets. In
\abbreviation{ZFC}+\abbreviation{FOL}, this category is undefinable\footnote{In
  particular, its formation is prevented by the axiom of regularity
  \cite{vonneumann}, which was included in \abbreviation{ZFC} to avoid the
  paradoxes of Burali-Forti and Russell. The discovery of said paradoxes
  motivated Bertrand Russell to invent something he called the ``theory of
  types'' \cite{russell}.}.
\Crefrange{sec:basics}{sec:functors-and-their-algebras}, 
are willfully imprecise, we work with an abstract and undefined notion of
``collection'', and adopt set-theoretic notation. See any textbook on category
theory for information on how problems of size are dealt with set-theoretically.
We will examine category theory within \abbreviation{UTT} in
\cref{sec:type-theoretic-category-theory}.

\section{Basics}
\label{sec:basics}


\TODO{Type theory and category theory are intimately connected via the
      discipline of \textit{topos theory}}%\index{Topos theory}.}

\begin{definition}
	A \textbf{category}\index{Category} $\bfC$ consists of the following data:
  \begin{itemize}
    \itemsep-0.2em
    \item a collection of \textbf{objects}, denoted $\Obj \bfC$,
    \item for each pair of objects $A,B\in\Obj \bfC$, a collection of
      \textbf{arrows} (or \textbf{morphisms}) between them, denoted
        $\Hom_{\bfC}(A,B)$,
    \item for each object $A\in\Obj \bfC$, a distinguished arrow
      $\id_A\in\Hom_{\bfC}(A,A)$ called the
      \textbf{identity}\index{Identity!Morphism}, and
    \item for each triple of objects $A,B,C\in\Obj\bfC$, an operation \\
      $\circ:\Hom_{\bfC}(B,C)\times\Hom_{\bfC}(A,B)\to\Hom_{\bfC}(A,C)$ called
      \textbf{composition}\index{Composition!In a category}.
  \end{itemize}
  These data are subject to the following axioms:
  \begin{enumerate}%[label=\Alph*.]
    \itemsep-0.2em
    \item composition is associative, and
    \item the identity acts as a unit for composition.
  \end{enumerate}
  When the category in question is clear from context, one writes $f:A\to B$ for
  $f\in\Hom_{\bfC}(A,B)$. 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}\label{def:domain-and-codomain}
  If $f\in\Hom_{\bfC}(A,B)$, then $A$ is the \textbf{domain}\index{Domain} or
  \textbf{source}\index{Source} of $f$ and $B$ is the
  \textbf{codomain}\index{Codomain} or \textbf{target}\index{Target} of $f$.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
  A student of mathematics will be familiar with the following categories:
  \begin{itemize}
    \itemsep-0.2em
    \item $\Set$: The category with sets as objects, functions as morphisms, 
      the usual composition of functions, and identity functions.
    \item $\Grp$: The category of groups\index{Group} with group homomorphisms
      as morphisms. Note that the identity function of sets is the required
      identity morphism and that for any homomorphsisms $\phi:G\to H$ and
      $\psi:H\to I$, the usual composition of functions defines a homomorphism
      $\psi\circ \phi:G\to I$.
    \item $\AbGrp$: The category of abelian groups (this can be considered a
      \textbf{subcategory} of $\Grp$).
    \item $F\dVect$: The category of vector spaces\index{Vector space} over a
      field $F$ with linear transformations as morphisms.
    \item For any group $(G,\circ,e)$, there is a corresponding category
      $\underline{G}$ with a single object (denoted $\ast$) and
      $\Hom_{\underline{G}}(\ast,\ast)\coloneqq G$. Composition is given by the
      group operation.
  \end{itemize}
\end{example}

\begin{definition}\label{def:isomorphism}
	An \textbf{isomorphism}\index{Isomorphism!In a category} in $\bfC$ is an arrow
  $f\in\Hom_{\bfC}(A,B)$ such that there exists an arrow $g\in\Hom_{\bfC}(B,A)$
  such that $g\circ f=\id_A$ and $f\circ g=\id_B$. We call such a $g$ the
  \textbf{inverse}\index{Inverse!In a category} of $f$.
\end{definition}

Just as with functions, inverses (should they exist) are unique.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=2]
    \node (A) [] {$\ast$};

    \foreach \x in {1,2,3} 
      \draw (A) edge [in={50*\x},out={40+50*\x},loop] node[above] {$g_\x$} (A);

    \draw (A) edge [in=200,out=240,loop] node[below] {$\cdots$} (A);

    group $G$ with identity $e$ and elements $g_1,g_2,\ldots$. Compositions and
    inverses not shown.
  }
\end{figure}

\begin{definition}\label{def:commutative-diagram}
  A commutative diagram is a way to visualize equations between arrows
  involving composition. Technically a diagram in $\bfC$ is a directed graph
  with vertices labeled by $\Obj\bfC$. If $e$ is an edge from $A$ to $B$, then it
  is labeled by an arrow in $\Hom_\bfC(A,B)$. A diagram \textbf{commutes}, or is
  commutative, if the composition of the arrows labeling the edges of any two
  directed paths with the same endpoints are equal.
  \TODO{better wording}
\end{definition}

\begin{example}\label{ex:commutative-diagram}
	If $f\in\Hom_{\bfC}(A,B)$, $g\in\Hom_{\bfC}(B,C)$, $h\in\Hom_{\bfC}(A,C)$,
  and $g\circ f=h$, then we may draw the following
  \textbf{commutative triangle}:
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzcd}[column sep=large]
      A \arrow[r, "f"] \arrow[dr, "h"] & B \arrow[d, "g"] \\
      {}                               & C
    \end{tikzcd}
  \end{center}
	If $f\in\Hom_{\bfC}(A,B)$, $g\in\Hom_{\bfC}(B,D)$, $h\in\Hom_{\bfC}(A,C)$,
  $i\in\Hom_{\bfC}(C,D)$, and $g\circ f=i\circ h$, then we may draw the
  following \textbf{commutative square}:
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzcd}[column sep=large]
      A \arrow[r, "f"]  \arrow[d, "h"] & B \arrow[d, "g"] \\
      C \arrow[r, "i"]                 & D
    \end{tikzcd}
  \end{center}
\end{example}

\section{Duality}
\label{sec:duality}

From now on, dual concepts and statements will be introduced in pairs, and
typeset like so:

\dual{

\section{Limits and colimits}
\label{sec:limits-and-colimits}

For this section, fix an arbitrary category $\bfC$.\TODO{elsewhere?}

\begin{definition}\label{def:terminal-and-initial}
  \
  \vspace{-0.3em}\dual{
    A \textbf{terminal object}\index{Terminal object} is an
    object $\top\in\Obj\bfC$ such that for all $A\in\Obj\bfC$,
    there is exactly one arrow $f:A\to\top$.
  }{
    An \textbf{initial object}\index{Initial object} is an
    object $\bot\in\Obj\bfC$ such that for all $A\in\Obj\bfC$,
    there is exactly one arrow $f:\bot\to A$.
  }
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}\label{def:product-and-coproduct}
  Given two objects $A,B\in\Obj\bfC$,
  \vspace{-0.3em}\dual{
    a \textbf{product}\index{Product!In a category} of $A$ and $B$
    consists of an object $C\in\Obj\bfC$ together with arrows $p_1:C\to A$ and
    $p_2:C\to B$ satisfying the following universal property:

    For any other ``candidate product'' $D\in\Obj\bfC$ with arrows
    $q_1:D\to A$ and $q_2:D\to B$, there is a unique arrow $u:D\to C$ making the
    following diagram commute:
    \begin{center}
      \begin{tikzcd}[sep=large,ampersand replacement=\&]
        {} \& D\arrow[dl,swap,"q_1"]\arrow[dr,"q_2"]
              \arrow[d,dashed,"u"] \& {} \\
        A \& C \arrow[l, "p_1"]\arrow[r,swap, "p_2"] \& B
      \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}
    If $C$ is a product of $A$ and $B$, we will denote it by $A\times B$, and
    the unque arrow $u$ as $\langle f,g \rangle$.
  }{
    a \textbf{coproduct}\index{Coproduct!In a category} of $A$ and $B$
    consists of an object $C\in\Obj\bfC$ together with arrows $i_1:A\to C$ and
    $i_2:B\to C$ satisfying the following universal property:

    For any other ``candidate coproduct'' $D\in\Obj\bfC$ with arrows
    $j_1:A\to D$ and $j_2:B\to D$, there is a unique arrow $u:C\to D$ making the
    following diagram commute:
    \begin{center}
      \begin{tikzcd}[sep=large,ampersand replacement=\&]
        A \arrow[r, "i_1"{name=I1}]\arrow[dr, swap, "j_1"{name=F}]
        \& C \arrow[d,dashed,"u"]
        \& B\arrow[l, "i_2"{name=I2},swap]\arrow[dl,"j_2"{name=G}] \\
        {} \& D \& {}
      \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}
    If $C$ is a coproduct of $A$ and $B$, we will denote it by $A+B$, and
    the unque arrow $u$ as $[f,g]$.
  }
\end{definition}

\section{Functors and their algebras}
\label{sec:functors-and-their-algebras}

\begin{definition}\label{def:functor}
	A \textbf{functor}\index{Functor} $F$ between categories $\bfC$ and $\bfD$
  consists of the following data:
  \begin{itemize}
    \itemsep-0.2em
    \item a map $F_0:\Obj \bfC\to\Obj \bfD$ 
    \item for each pair of objects $A,B\in\Obj C$, a map \\
      $F_1:\Hom_{\bfC}(A,B) \to\Hom_{\bfD}(F_0(A),F_0(B))$ 
  \end{itemize}
  These data are subject to the following axioms:
  \begin{enumerate}%[label=\Alph*.]
    \itemsep-0.2em
    \item functors preserve composition
    \item $F(\id_A)=\id_{F(A)}$ for all $A\in\Obj C$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

We generally leave off the subscripts and parentheses when possible, denoting
the application by simply $FA$ or $Ff$. A functor $F$ from $\bfC$ to
$\bfD$ may be denoted $F:\bfC\to\bfD$. We may define functors without names
using the following notation:
\begin{align*}
  \bfC &\longrightarrow \bfD \\
  A    &\longmapsto_0 \ldots \\
  f    &\longmapsto_1 \ldots
\end{align*}

\begin{example}\label{ex:identity-functor-cat}
  For any category $\bfC$, there is an \textbf{identity
  functor}\index{Identity!Functor} $\id_{\bfC}\bfC\to\bfC$ which acts as the
  identity on objects and morphisms. The composition of functors is associative,
  and there is a category $\Cat$ of ``small'' categories (it doesn't include
  itself, for instance).
\end{example}

\begin{example}\label{ex:forget}
  For each category of algebraic objects where the morphisms are the
  corresponding type of homomorphism, there is a \textbf{forgetful functor},
  generally denoted $U$, which takes sets with some structure to their
  underlying sets and homomorphisms to the corresponding maps of sets. For
  instance, there is a forgetful functor $U:\Grp\to\Set$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}\label{example:coproduct-functoriality}
	If $\bfC$ has distinguished binary coproducts, then 
  for any fixed $A,B\in\Obj\bfC$, one can define the following
  functors:\footnote{Really, this is a consequence of the fact that $+$ is
    what's called a \textbf{bifunctor}\indeX{Bifunctor}, but we don't need the
    full power of that statement for our purposes.}
  \begin{align*}
    \begin{split}
      \bfC &\longrightarrow \bfC \\
      X    &\longmapsto_0 A + X \\
      f    &\longmapsto_1 \id_A+f = [i_1, i_2\circ f]
    \end{split}
    \begin{split}
      \bfC &\longrightarrow \bfC \\
      Y    &\longmapsto_0 Y + B \\
      g    &\longmapsto_1 g+\id_B = [i_1\circ g, i_2]
    \end{split}
  \end{align*}
\end{example}

Since functors preserve sources, targets, and composition, they preserve
commutative diagrams. If $f,g,h$ form a commutative triangle in $\bfC$, then
their images under $F:\bfC\to\bfD$ do in $\bfD$:
\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzcd}[column sep=large]
    A\arrow[dr, "f"]\arrow[dd, "h"]\arrow[rr,mapsto,"F"] & {} & F A
    \arrow[dr, "F f"] \arrow[dd, near start, "F h", crossing over] & {} \\
    {} & B\arrow[dl, "g"]\arrow[rr,near start, mapsto, "F", crossing over] & {}
    & F B \arrow[dl, "F g"]\\
    C \arrow[rr,mapsto,"F"]& {} & F C &  {}
  \end{tikzcd}

Note however that it is possible that $FA=FB=FC$, as in a functor to a category
with a single object. However, the equalties between composites still hold.
One consequence is that functors preserve isomorphism.

\begin{definition}\label{def:endofunctor}
	An \textbf{endofunctor}\index{Functor!Endofunctor} is a functor with identical
  domain and codomain.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}\label{def:f-coalgebra}
  \
  \vspace{-0.3em}\dual{
    An \textbf{algebra}\index{(Co)algebra for a functor} for an endofunctor
    $F:\bfC\to\bfC$ (also called an $F$\textbf{-algebra}) is a pair
    $(A,\alpha)$ of an object $A\in\Obj\bfC$ and an arrow $\alpha:FA\to A$.

    A \textbf{coalgebra} for an endofunctor
    $F:\bfC\to\bfC$ (also called an $F$\textbf{-coalgebra}) is a pair
    $(A,\alpha)$ of an object $A\in\Obj\bfC$ and an arrow $\alpha:A\to FA$
    \cite{category-theory-for-computing-science}.
  }
\end{definition}

For now, we will concentrate on properties of functor coalgebras, though all
constructions in this section hold dually for algebras.

\begin{definition}\label{def:coalgebra-morphism}
  A \textbf{coalgebra morphism}\index{(Co)algebra morphism} from
  $(A,\alpha)$ to $(B,\beta)$ is an arrow $f:A\to B$ such that the following
  diagram commutes:
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzcd}
      A  \arrow[d, "\alpha"] \arrow[r, "f"] & B \arrow[d, "\beta"] \\
      FA \arrow[r, "Ff"] & FB
    \end{tikzcd}
  \end{center}
\end{definition}

Since $F$ is a functor, the composition of coalgebra morphisms is again a
coalgebra morphism. In fact, $F$-coalgebras have all of the structure of a
category, which we will call $F\Coalg$.\TODO{Proof?}

\begin{definition}
  \
  \vspace{-0.3em}\dual{
    An \textbf{initial $F$-algebra}\index{Initial algebra} is an initial
    object of $F\Alg$.
  }{
    An \textbf{final $F$-coalgebra}\index{Final coalgebra} is a terminal
    object of $F\Coalg$.
  }
\end{definition}

The following example is crucial to
\cref{chap:coinductive-types-in-univalent-type-theory}.

\begin{example}
  Let $\bfC$ be a category with distinguished binary coproducts and a terminal
  object $1$. Consider the functor
  \begin{align*}
    F:\bfC &\longrightarrow \bfC  \\
    A &\longmapsto_0 1+A \\
    f &\longmapsto_1 \id_1+f
  \end{align*}
  where 1 is a terminal object\index{Terminal object} and $+$ is the coproduct
  bifunctor as in \ref{lemma:coproduct-functorality}. Let's examine
  what it \textit{means} for some $F$-algebra $(N,\eta)$ to be initial. By
  composing with the coproduct\index{Coproduct!In category theory} injections,
  we can define
  \begin{align*}
    \begin{split}
      z &: 1 \longrightarrow N \\
      z &= \eta\circ i_1
    \end{split}
    \begin{split}
      s &: 1 \longrightarrow N \\
      s &= \eta\circ i_2
    \end{split}
  \end{align*}
  so that $\eta=[z,s]$:
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzcd}[sep=large,ampersand replacement=\&]
      1 \arrow[r, "i_1"{name=I1}]\arrow[dr, swap, "z"{name=F}]
      \& 1+N \arrow[d,"\eta"]
      \& N\arrow[l, "i_2"{name=I2},swap]\arrow[dl,"s"{name=G}] \\
      {} \& N \& {}
    \end{tikzcd}
  \end{center}
  Suppose we have another $F$-algebra $(A,\alpha)$, and we define $f,g$ by
  composition as above so that $\alpha=[f,g]$. By initiality of $(N,\eta)$,
  there is a unique arrow $u$ making the following diagram commute:
  \newcommand{\eeeeeta}{[z,s]}
  \newcommand{\aaaaalpha}{[f,g]}
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzcd}[sep=large]
      1+N \arrow[r, dashed, "\id_1+u"]\arrow[d, "\eeeeeta"] & 1+A\arrow[d, "\aaaaalpha"]  \\
      N \arrow[r, dashed, "u"] & A
    \end{tikzcd}
  \end{center}
  By functoriality of the coproduct (\ref{example:coproduct-functoriality}), we can
  compose along either the left- or right-hand paths in the above diagram.
  The above square states $u\circ [z,s]= [f,g]\circ (\id_1+u)$. Precomposing
  with $i_1:1\to 1+N$ yields
  \begin{align*}
    u\circ z = u\circ [z,s]\circ i_1
    &= [f,g]\circ (\id_1+u) \circ i_1 
    &&\quad\text{Above diagram} \\
    &= [f,g]\circ [i_1,i_2\circ u] \circ i_1 
    &&\quad\text{Definition of }+ \\
    &= [f, g]\circ i_1 \\
    &= f
  \end{align*}
  By similar reasoning, precomposing with $i_2$ yields
  \begin{equation*}
    u\circ s = u\circ [z,s] \circ i_2
    = [f,g]\circ(\id_1+u)\circ i_2
    = g\circ u.
  \end{equation*}
  Combining the above two equations, we have the following universal property
  for $(N,\eta)$. For any object $A$ with arrows $f:1\to A$ and $g:A\to A$,
  there is a unique arrow $u:N\to A$ making the following diagram commute:
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzcd}[sep=large]
      1
        \arrow[r, "z"]
        \arrow[dr, swap, "f"]
        & N \arrow[r, "s"] \arrow[d, "u", dashed]
        & N \arrow[d, "u", dashed] \\
      {}
      & A \arrow[r, "g"]
      & A
    \end{tikzcd}
  \end{center}
  Well, we've successfully rephrased the property of initiality, but it seems
  just as cryptic now as it was then. Let's see if we can figure out what an
  type with this property would look like in our favorite category $\caU$, the
  universe of small types in \abbreviation{ITT}!

  Let $\operatorname{List}\N$ be the type of lists of natural numbers
  as in \cref{subsubsec:lists}. To utilize the above property, we need
  an arrow $\textbf{1}\to \operatorname{List}\N$, in other words, any inhabitant
  of $\operatorname{List}\N$. Let's choose $[]$, the empty list.
  We also need a function $\operatorname{List}\N\to \operatorname{List}\N$.
  Choose $\lambda l.5::l$, the function that prepends $5$ to $l$. In summary, we
  have:
  \begin{itemize}
    \itemsep0em
    \item $A:\equiv \operatorname{List}\N$
    \item $f:\equiv \lambda x.[]$
    \item $g:\equiv \lambda l.5::l$
  \end{itemize}
  From the universal property of $(N,[z,s])$, we get a function
  $u:N\to \operatorname{List} A$ such that
  \begin{align*}
    u(z) = []
    &&\text{and}&&
    u(s(n)) = 5::(u(n))
  \end{align*}
  Look familiar yet? Indeed, one type with such a property is $\N$! In that
  case, $u$ is the function that, when given a number $n$, outputs a list of $5$s
  with length $n$.\footnote{In $\Set$, $\N$ would be an initial algebra.
    It makes sense to ask if this functor has an initial algebra in any
    category with a terminal object and chosen binary coproducts, and in
    general, such algebras are called \textbf{natural number objects} (NNOs) 
    \cite{sketches}.
