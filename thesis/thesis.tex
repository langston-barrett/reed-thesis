This thesis has presented univalent type theory, a modified version of Martin-Löf
dependent type theory inspired by a homotopy-theoretic semantics. The
presentation began somewhat historically, first discussing intuitionistic
logic and the λ-calculus, describing their interplay via the BHK interpretation
and Curry-Howard correspondence, and going on to describe how enrichments of
these systems lead to full-blown type theory. This perspective emphasizes
the harmonic interplay between the logical and computational aspects of this
theory. 

In \cref{chap:type-theory}, we saw some organizational principles such as
hlevels, weak equivalences, and characterization of paths inspired by the
homotopy model. Notably, this conceptual framework, motivated by spatial
intuition, greatly eased the decidedly non-topological work of later chapters. 
The univalent perspective ends up being useful in practice for logicians and
computer scientists, and not just topologists.

\Crefrange{chap:category-theory}{chap:coinductive-types-in-univalent-type-theory}
describe applications of \UTT{}. The development of (higher) category theory in
type theory continues to be an area of active research with rich results.
In keeping a well-understood pattern in the practice of constructive mathematics,
\UTT{} allows for the definition and exploration of classically-equivalent
concepts (e.g.\ categories and precategories), resulting in a more fine-grained
and general theory. Type theory is not ``just another'' foundational system in
which to do the exact same mathematics one might do in set theory, but indeed
gives rise to interesting, nontrivial, classically-inexpressible results.

While all results in this thesis were formalized in the computer proof assistant
\Coq{}, the workings, benefits, and limitations of such systems were mostly
relegated to footnotes when present at all. The methodology of computerized proof
undergoes an extended renaissance as computer scientists become more
interested in formally verified code and a wider community of mathematicians
begin to worry about the robustness of current (informal) proof-checking
procedures or get excited about \HoTT{}.

The type theory research community is small, yet vibrant. There are incredibly
important questions in the foundations of the theory itself (Is there a
constructive model of \UTT{}? Voevodsky's construction uses the axiom of
choice.), in its use as a framework for mathematics (How can one work
effectively with structures like $\R$ within a constructive theory?), and
in its implementations in proof assistants (How can we effectively use
automation in proofs?). Due to the proliferation of such concerns and the
ability to utilize intuitions from functional programming or algebraic topology,
type theory is a field in which even undergraduates can work on significant
research-level questions.
