\chapter*{Abstract}

In this thesis I explain univalent type theory, a constructive and
computationally meaningful foundational system for mathematics inspired by
recent advances in the model theory of Per Martin-L\"of's intuitionistic type
theory. I first develop the classical propositions/types correspondence between
intuitionistic natural deduction and the λ-calculus. I proceed to explicate
Martin-L\"of's theory of dependent types and the central modern development in
type theory: Vladimir Voevodsky's univalence principle. I go on to examine some
category theory and the nature of coinduction within this theory, presenting a
novel formalization of (parts of) a recent result that M-types can be derived
\textit{internally} in univalent type theory.

Mathematicians err. Some acknowledge mistakes in their published work and
try to move on. For others, the experience can be life-changing. In 1998, Carlos
Simpson released a pre-print arguing that there was a major mistake in one of
Vladimir Voevodsky's 1989 papers \cite{voevodsky-presentation}. It was not
immediately clear whether Voevodsky had erred, or whether there was a flaw in
Simpson's counterexample. In 1999, Pierre Deligne found a crucial mistake in
Voevodsky's 1992/93 ``Cohomological Theory of Presheaves with Transfers'', upon
which he had based much of his work in the area of ``motivic cohomology''. As he
began to develop more and more complex arguments, Voevodsky wondered: ``And who
would ensure that I did not forget something and did not make a mistake, if even
the mistakes in much more simple arguments take years to uncover?''
\cite{voevodsky-ias}.

Elsewhere in mathematics, new developments raised questions for traditional
methodology. Complexity, specialization and sheer length made
proofs difficult to comprehend with the absolute certainty which is
supposed to characterize this discipline. In the 1970s, two teams of
topologists proved contradictory results, and neither group could find the error
in the other's proof \cite{kolata}. Wiles's famous proof of Fermat's last
theorem was utterly unintelligible to the vast majority of mathematicians
\cite{nyt}. The classification of the simple finite groups---one of the field's
crowning achievements---has a combined proof of over ten thousand pages.

The problems facing Voevodsky and his peers seemed insurmountable.
As the requisite attention span, memory, and capacity for detail required to
check new developments in higer mathematics reached inhuman proportions,
where were they to turn? In a fit of interdisciplinary collaborative spirit,
Voevodsky began to explore an avenue well-known to philosophers and computer
scientists, but relatively obscure within mathematics: type theory.

\paragraph{An abbreviated history of modern type theory.} After the paradoxes
and philosophical debates of the early 20\textsuperscript{th} century, most
mathematicians settled on classical first-order logic (\FOL{}) and an axiomatic
set theory called \ZFC{} as the gold standard of rigor. Virtually all of
contemporary research was built on these foundations. However, there remained
some vocal opposition by logicians and philosophers to these newly-adopted
methods. Most mathematicians are dimly aware that there's some controversy about
the Axiom of Choice (the ``C'' in \ZFC{}) \cite{martin-lof-100-years}, but one
doesn't have to look further than \FOL{} to find disagreements.

Brouwer, Heyting, and other intuitionists decried the use of the law
of excluded middle (or equivalently, double-negation elimination). Russell
doubted the consistency of impredicative (self-referential) definitions.
In the 1970s, philosopher and logician Per Martin-Löf created a predicative,
intuitionistically-acceptable logical system called type theory as an
alternative foundational system for ``constructive''
mathematics.\footnote{Constructive and intuitionistic mathematics differ in
their philosophical points, but mostly accord on choice of logical principles.}

Brouwer, Heyting, and Kolmogorov had all at various points suggested that
intuitionistic logic could be understood not only as a theory of truth, but also
as a theory of ``problems'' (propositions) and their ``solutions'' (proofs)
\cite{kolmogorov}. Elsewhere, Haskell Curry noticed that his formalism for
describing computations shared some surprising features with intuitionistic
logic \cite{curry-howard}. These observations were synthesized and extended by
William Howard, who noticed that intuitionistic ``natural deduction''
corresponds closely to a computational system called the λ-calculus (\LC{}).
The postcard version of the truth is that Martin-Löf was aware of these
connections between constructive logic and computation, and his type theory
could actually serve as \textit{both} an advanced, (very) high-level programming
language \textit{and} a foundational system for mathematics (details to come in
\cref{chap:propositions-and-types}).

Computer scientists Theirry Coquand and Christine Pauline took this Curry/Howard
thing very seriously. They developed a variant of Martin-Löf's type theory called
the Calculus of Constructions \cite{coquand}, and it was implemented as the
programming language \Coq{} \cite{coq-manual}.\footnote{The French word for
``rooster'', in the tradition of naming software after animals (a lá
\software{OCaml}).} Computer scientists, facing the problem of ensuring the
correctness of algorithms and the programs based on them, developed this and
other ``proof assistants'' in order to produce machine-verifiable code. These
languages became Voevodsky's ``tools''.

\paragraph{The simplicial set model.}
Voevodsky was an algebraic topologist and
geometer by training. In 2011 in the unpublished \textit{Notes on type systems},
and later in summaries and reformulations, Voevodsky discovered a new model of
\Coq{}'s (core) type theory. In this model, types are interpreted as Kan complexes,
a highly technical and abstract representation of spaces. Voevodsky and others
were thus able to utilize intuitions from algebraic topology and category theory
to develop proofs in type theory.

The model inspired two additional logical principles for type theory. The
Calculus of Constructions together with these ``higher inductive types''
and the ``univalence axiom'' was called homotopy type theory (\HoTT{}),
referring explicitly to its newfound semantics.

\paragraph{The \UniMath{} library.} Voevodsky's initial experiments with
formalizing proofs in \Coq{} turned into a library called
\software{Foundations}. This and other libraries of code utilizing the
univalence axiom were merged into the \UniMath{} library. The development of
this formalism in \Coq{} faces one fundamental barrier: When assuming axioms in
type theory, one loses the computational behavior.

Developing a ``computational interpretation'' of the univalence axiom, that is,
the creation of a (computationally meaningful) type theory in which it is a
theorem rather than an axiom, remains an area of active research. In the
expectation that there will someday be a proof assistant implementing such a
type theory (and for a simpler metatheory), the \UniMath{} library uses a
minimal type theory that we'll develop in this thesis called univalent type
theory, or \UTT{}.

\paragraph{(Co)induction.} ``Inductive'' types such as the natural numbers $\ℕ$,
lists, and binary trees, and their ``coinductive'' versions such as streams (not
necesssarily finite lists) and infinite binary trees, are essential to any
modern proof assistant (or more broadly, functional programming language).
However, their presence is generally postulated, rather than derived. Thus,
\UniMath{} disallows such definitions.

However, recent results have shown that one can derive the presence of
coinductive types within \UTT{} while only postulating the natural numbers.
This result has been formalized within the proof assistant \Agda{}, one goal of
the present work is to prove (some of) that result in \Coq{}, and integrate it
into \UniMath{} so that it may be practically utilized by a wider research
community. 

Hence, the results in this thesis have been formalized in the \Coq{} proof
assistant. They were subsequently reviewed (by the \UniMath{}
development team \cite{unimath} and Anders Mörtberg) and accepted into the
\UniMath{} library. Their names appear in a monospaced font (e.g.\
\unimathname{univalence}).

This thesis has presented univalent type theory, a modified version of Martin-Löf
dependent type theory inspired by a homotopy-theoretic semantics. The
presentation began somewhat historically, first discussing intuitionistic
logic and the λ-calculus, describing their interplay via the BHK interpretation
and Curry-Howard correspondence, and going on to describe how enrichments of
these systems lead to full-blown type theory. This perspective emphasizes
the harmonic interplay between the logical and computational aspects of this
theory. 

In \cref{chap:type-theory}, we saw some organizational principles such as
hlevels, weak equivalences, and characterization of paths inspired by the
homotopy model. Notably, this conceptual framework, motivated by spatial
intuition, greatly eased the decidedly non-topological work of later chapters. 
The univalent perspective ends up being useful in practice for logicians and
computer scientists, and not just topologists.

\Crefrange{chap:category-theory}{chap:coinductive-types-in-univalent-type-theory}
describe applications of \UTT{}. The development of (higher) category theory in
type theory continues to be an area of active research with rich results.
In keeping a well-understood pattern in the practice of constructive mathematics,
\UTT{} allows for the definition and exploration of classically-equivalent
concepts (e.g.\ categories and precategories), resulting in a more fine-grained
and general theory. Type theory is not ``just another'' foundational system in
which to do the exact same mathematics one might do in set theory, but indeed
gives rise to interesting, nontrivial, classically-inexpressible results.

While all results in this thesis were formalized in the computer proof assistant
\Coq{}, the workings, benefits, and limitations of such systems were mostly
relegated to footnotes when present at all. The methodology of computerized proof
undergoes an extended renaissance as computer scientists become more
interested in formally verified code and a wider community of mathematicians
begin to worry about the robustness of current (informal) proof-checking
procedures or get excited about \HoTT{}.

The type theory research community is small, yet vibrant. There are incredibly
important questions in the foundations of the theory itself (Is there a
constructive model of \UTT{}? Voevodsky's construction uses the axiom of
choice.), in its use as a framework for mathematics (How can one work
effectively with structures like $\R$ within a constructive theory?), and
in its implementations in proof assistants (How can we effectively use
automation in proofs?). Due to the proliferation of such concerns and the
ability to utilize intuitions from functional programming or algebraic topology,
type theory is a field in which even undergraduates can work on significant
research-level questions.
