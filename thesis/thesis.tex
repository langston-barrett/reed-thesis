\chapter{Propositions and Types}
\label[chapter]{chap:propositions-and-types}

In this chapter, we will present first a logical and then a computational
framework. We will begin with general remarks on discussing and defining formal
systems in \cref{sec:discussing-logic}. \Cref{sec:ipl} begins with an
intuitionistic, proof-relevant version of Gentzen's natural deduction
\cite{gentzen1935untersuchungen} called \IPL{}. As most
mathematicians, computer scientists, and philosophers are familiar with some
version of first-order logic, this section will focus on the introduction of
notation, meta-logical concerns, and the key differences between
\IPL{} and \FOL. In \cref{sec:the-lambda-calculus}, we
will introduce Church's λ-calculus \LC{} (and the simply-typed and
typed versions \STLC{} and \TLC{}). Finally, in
\cref{sec:propositions-and-types}, we will discuss the fundamental and
harmonious relation between these systems known as the Curry-Howard
correspondence.\TODO{Motivate the formality of this chapter}

The vocabulary of \cref{sec:discussing-logic} is due to Martin-Löf. He
emphasized the importance of the notion of judgment (\cref{def:judgment})
\cite{martin-lof-meanings} and justified the rules of his type theory
by meaning explanations \cite{martin-lof-constructive}, which we will imitate
in \cref{subsec:ipl-intro}. See \cite{modal-judgment} for a similar application
of Martin-L\"of vocabulary to modal logic, and \cite{hott-meaning} for a
justification of \HoTT using meaning explanations.

In addition to Martin-Löf-style meaning explanantions, in
\cref{subsec:proof-terms} we explore  Dummett's 

The presentation of \crefrange{sec:ipl}{sec:the-lambda-calculus} is influenced by
Philip Wadler \cite{wadler-propositions}, Frank Pfenning's lecture notes for
``Constructive Logic'', and Robert Harper's lectures on
\HoTT.\TODO{citation}

Two recent Reed graduates wrote theses on the Curry-Howard correspondence, both
taking a different approach in presentation that may complement this work,
\cite{curry-howard-reed-thesis} and \cite{process-calculi-reed-thesis}.

\begin{notation}\label[notation]{notation:parens}
  Throughout this thesis, we will omit parentheses when applying function-like
  constructions wherever this results in no ambiguity. Function application is
  left-associative. For example, for function-like constructions $f$, $g$, $h$,
  and $i$ we have
  \begin{align*}
    \apply{f}{h}=f(h) &&
    f(\apply{g}{h})=f(g(h)) && \appply{f}{(\apply{g}{i})}{h}=f(g(i))(h)
  \end{align*}
  and so on.
\end{notation}

\section{Discussing logic}
\label{sec:discussing-logic}

The observant student of logic may notice a problem in the usual definition of
implication: one usually defines $P→ Q$ as ``if whenever $P$ is true,
$Q$ is true, then $P→ Q$ is true''. It seems that in order to understand
implication, one must first understand implication! More perniciously,
philosophers and mathematicians alike have argued that Skolem's
``paradox''\footnote{(An application of) the L\"owenheim-Skolem theorem states
  that if there is a model of \ZFC, there is a countable one.
  The paradox is that the statement ``there are uncountable sets'' is (famously)
  a theorem of \ZFC, Cantor's.}
has deep and significant consequences for the philosophy of
mathematics \cite{skolem}. These misunderstandings both arise from a common
root: the failure to distinguish between object language and metalanguage. In
this section, we will attempt to mitigate some of the difficulties that arise
when discussing and defining formal systems for logic and computation.

\begin{definition}\label[definition]{def:object-meta-language}
  When discussing or defining a formal language (most commonly, a
  logico-deductive framework), we call that language the
  \define{object language}\index{object language}. Our discussion takes place in
  a \define{metalanguage}.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
  \
  \begin{itemize}
    \itemsep0em
    \item In the statement ``\FOL is complete'', \FOL
      is the object language, and the metalanguage is English.
    \item G\"odel's second incompleteness theorem is a statement in the
      metalanguage of \FOL+\ZFC, about the object
      language of Peano arithmetic.
  \end{itemize}
\end{example}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=1.1]{figures/nested-languages.pdf}
  \caption{\label{fig:nested}Nested languages, formal and informal. Outer boxes
    are meta-languages, inner boxes are object languages.}
\end{figure}

\begin{definition}\label[definition]{def:metavariable}
	A \define{metavariable}\index{Metavariable} is a variable meant to stand for
  any expression of our object language.
\end{definition}

\begin{notation}
  In imitation of various proof assistants, we will prefix metavariables with
  question mark, e.g.\ $\mvar{a}$.
\end{notation}

See \cref{fig:structure}, \cref{ex:judgments}, and \cref{sec:ipl} for examples
of uses of metavariables.

\begin{definition}\label[definition]{def:judgment}
	A \define{judgment}\index{Judgment} is something that could be known. A
  judgment is \define{evident} if one does, in fact, know it.
  A \define{proof} evidence for a judgment.
  A \define{hypothetical judgment}\index{Judgment!Hypothetical} is one that
  holds under the assumption that some other judgments hold.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}\label[example]{ex:judgments}
  Here are some examples of common judgments in logic (where the metavariables
  in these examples are to be understood as ranging over expressions of some
  unspecified object language):
  \begin{itemize}
    \itemsep0em
    \item $\mvar{a}$ is a well-formed formula
    \item $\mvar{a}$ is a proposition
    \item if $\mvar{a}$ and $\mvar{b}$ are propositions, then
      $\mvar{a}\land \mvar{b}$ is a proposition (this judgment is hypothetical)
    \item $\mvar{a}$ will happen in the future
    \item $\mvar{a}$ is a program with type $\mvar{t}$
    \item $\mvar{a}$ is true
    \item the variable $v$ is free (resp.\ bound) in $\mvar{a}$
  \end{itemize}
  If one is working in a formal metalanguage, judgments may be defined
  inductively in it.
\end{example}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \begin{equation*}
    \overbrace{\text{I know} \overbrace{\underbrace{\mvar{A}}_{\text{Expression}}\text{ is true}}^{\text{Judgment}}}^{\text{Evident judgment}}
  \end{equation*}
  \caption{\label{fig:structure}The structure of a judgment (transcribed
    from \cite{martin-lof-meanings})}
\end{figure}

% Since this thesis will define several different formal systems, it
% will be useful to establish some uniform notation for such definitions.
% Therefore, the following definitions and notations are part of our
% meta-language, which is plain English.

\begin{notation}\label[notation]{notation:proof-tree}
  The premises and conclusions of proofs or rules of deduction are always
  judgments. If we can deduce a conclusion $K$ from premises $J_1,\ldots,J_n$
  via some rule R (again: $J_1,\ldots,J_n$ and $K$ are \textit{judgments},
  phrased in plain Enlgish, not terms of an object language)\footnote{These
    could be called meta-metavariables.},
  we will write
  \begin{align*}
    \prftree[r]{\footnotesize R}
      {J_1}{J_2}{\ldots}{J_n}
      {K}
    &&\text{or}&&
    \prftree[r]{\footnotesize R}
      {\prftree[r, noline]{}
        {J_1}
        {J_2}}
      {\prftree[r, noline]{}
        {J_3}
        {J_4}}
      {\ldots}{J_n}
      {K}.
  \end{align*}
  Iterating this notation, we can write long derivations as trees with the
  conclusion as their root.
\end{notation}

\begin{notation}\label[notation]{notation:sequent}
  If $K$ is a hypothetical judgment holding under assumptions $J_1,\ldots,J_n$,
  we denote this by $J_1,\ldots,J_n⊢ K$ (``$⊢$'' can be read ``entails'').
  There are three (seemingly) related notions that entailment is distinct from:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \itemsep0em
    \item Gentzen's notion of syntactic entailment, which we won't discuss here,
    \item the deduction of $K$ from premises $J_1,\ldots,J_n$ (shown in
      \cref{notation:proof-tree}), and
    \item implication (see \cref{subsec:ipl-intro} for more discussion of this
      distinction).
  \end{enumerate}
  To denote some arbitrary sequence of hypotheses, we will use capital Greek
  letters $Γ$, $Δ$, and $Θ$.\footnote{Again, these are sorts of
  meta-metavariables.}
\end{notation}

\begin{definition}\label[definition]{def:entailment-rules}
  Our notions of entailment will always allow for \define{reflexivity},
  \define{weakening}, \define{contraction}, \define{substitution}, and
  \IPL{} will allow for \define{exchange}, which are the following
  ``meta-rules'' (where $J$, $K$, and $L$ stand for judgments):
  \begin{gatherjot}
    \prftree[r]{\footnotesize refl}{}
      {Γ,J,Δ ⊢ J}
    \qquad
    \prftree[r]{\footnotesize weak}
      {Γ ⊢ J}
      {Γ,K ⊢ J}
    \qquad
    \prftree[r]{\footnotesize contr}
      {Γ,K,Δ,K,Θ ⊢ J}
      {Γ,K,Δ,Θ ⊢ J} \\
    \prftree[r]{\footnotesize subst}
      {Γ,K,Δ ⊢ J}{Γ ⊢ K}
      {Γ,Δ ⊢ J}
    \qquad
    \prftree[r]{\footnotesize ex}
      {Γ,J,Δ,K,Θ ⊢ L}
      {Γ,K,Δ,J,Θ ⊢ L}
  \end{gatherjot}
\end{definition}

\begin{notation}\label[notation]{notation:substitution}
  We denote the substitution of a term $t$ for all free occurrences variable $v$
  in an expression $e$ by $e[v\coloneqq t]$. We will not deal directly with the
  issues of variable capture, scoping, and substitution here, for a rigorous
  treatment see any thorough textbook on logic.

\section{Intuitionistic propositional logic}
\label{sec:ipl}

With these notations, we are prepared to define \IPL{}.
\Crefrange{sec:ipl}{sec:the-lambda-calculus} present these systems in some
degree of formality. Proofs in later chapters are not written in this style, but
it is important to see precisely specified versions of these logics in order to
understand \cref{sec:propositions-and-types}.

\subsection{Formation rules}
\label{subsec:ipl-form}

Since \IPL{} is supposed to be a logic, we better have a notion of a
proposition.\footnote{Why do we judge that terms are propositions, instead of
  well-formed formulae? Propositions are strictly more general. With
  hypothetical judgments, we can have a judgment of the form
  $\true{\mvar{a}}⊢ \prop{\mvar{b}}$, expressing that $\mvar{b}$ is a
  proposition \textit{under the assumption that $\mvar{a}$ is true}. We will
  need such expressive power in \cref{chap:type-theory}. This is also why we
  refrain from specifying our syntax via formal BNF (or similar) grammars.}
Indeed, we denote the judgment that some term $\mvar{a}$ represents a
proposition by $\prop{\mvar{a}}$. The following are the \define{formation
rules}\index{Formation!In \IFOL}:\footnote{For the less
  logically-versed reader: $⊤$ is read ``true'', $⊥$ is read ``false'',
  $\lnot$ is read ``not'', $\lor$ is read ``or'',
  $\land$ is read ``and'', $→$ is read ``implies'', $∀$ is read
  ``for all'', and $∃$ is read ``there exists''.
  \Cref{subsec:ipl-intro} attempts to justify these readings.}
\begin{gatherjot}
  \prftree[r]{}{}{Γ⊢\prop{⊤}}
  \qquad
  \prftree[r]{}{}{Γ⊢\prop{⊥}}
  \qquad
  \prftree[r]{}
    {\prop{Γ⊢\mvar{a}}}
    {\prop{Γ⊢\lnot \mvar{a}}} \\
  \prftree[r]{}
    {\prftree[r, noline]{}
      {Γ ⊢ \prop{\mvar{a}}}
      {Γ ⊢ \prop{\mvar{b}}}}
    {Γ⊢\prop{\mvar{a}→\mvar{b}}}
  \qquad
  \prftree[r]{}
    {\prftree[r, noline]{}
      {Γ ⊢ \prop{\mvar{a}}}
      {Γ ⊢ \prop{\mvar{b}}}}
    {Γ⊢\prop{\mvar{a}\land \mvar{b}}}
  \qquad
  \prftree[r]{}
    {\prftree[r, noline]{}
      {Γ ⊢ \prop{\mvar{a}}}
      {Γ ⊢ \prop{\mvar{b}}}}
    {Γ⊢\prop{\mvar{a}\lor\mvar{b}}} \\
  % \prftree[r]{}
  %    {\mvar{a}\prop}{v∉\FV(\mvar{a})}
  %    {∀ v.\mvar{a}}
  % \qquad
  % \prftree[r]{}
  %    {\mvar{a}\prop}{v∉\FV(\mvar{a})}
  %    {∃ v.\mvar{a}}
\end{gatherjot}
We add parentheses where necessary to disambiguate compound expressions.
As noted in \cref{tab:symbols}, ``$Γ$'', ``$⊢$'', and the horizontal line
``$\frac{\hspace{1em}}{\hspace{1em}}$'' are symbols in our metalanguage
(English), whereas ``$⊤,⊥,¬,→,∧,∨$'' are symbols in the object language
(\IPL{}). See \cref{tab:incoherent} for examples of some valid
expressions we could form with the above rules. Such valid expressions (in the
left column) are things that could be substituted in for our metavariables like
$\mvar{a}$.

\begin{table}[ht]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{l | l}
    \IPL{}                      & Incoherent \\ \hline
    $(\mvar{a}∧\mvar{b})∨\mvar{c}$          & $(Γ ⊢ \prop{\mvar{a}})∨\mvar{b}$ \\
    $(\mvar{a}→\mvar{b})→\mvar{c}$          & $∧∨→$ \\
    $⊤∨\mvar{a}_1∨\mvar{a}_2∨⋯∨\mvar{a}_n$  & $Γ⊢Θ$ \\
    $⊤→⊥$                                   & $\prop{\mvar{a}}→\mvar{b}∧\mvar{c}$ \\
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{\label{tab:incoherent}Valid \IPL{} expressions and incoherent
    nonsense.}
\end{table}

\subsection{Introduction rules}
\label{subsec:ipl-intro}

Martin-L\"of said ``The meaning of a proposition is determined by [...] what
counts as a verification of it'' \cite{martin-lof-meanings}. To
understand the meanings of the formation rules, we must define the judgment
``$\mvar{p}:\mvar{a}$'', read ``$\mvar{p}$ is a proof of $\mvar{a}$''. The
ways of proving a proposition are called \define{introduction rules}.

The symbol $⊤$ represents the trivially true proposition. Accordingly, we
give it a trivial proof (with a weird name which will make sense later):
\begin{equation*}
  \prftree[r]{}{}{Γ ⊢ \unitelem:⊤}.
\end{equation*}

How do we know a conjunction? Intuitively, we know (have a proof of) $\mvar{a}$
and $\mvar{b}$ (written $\mvar{a}\land\mvar{b}$) just when we know (have a proof
of) both $\mvar{a}$ and $\mvar{b}$. In symbols,
\begin{equation*}
  \prftree[r]{}
    {Γ ⊢ \prop{\mvar{a}}}{Γ ⊢ \prop{\mvar{b}}}
    {Γ ⊢ \mvar{p}:\mvar{a}}{Γ ⊢ \mvar{q}:\mvar{b}}
    {Γ ⊢ (\mvar{p},\mvar{q}):\mvar{a}\land\mvar{b}}.
\end{equation*}

What about disjunction? There are two ways to know $\mvar{a}$ or
$\mvar{b}$ (written $\mvar{a}\lor\mvar{b}$). We can either know $\mvar{a}$ or
know $\mvar{b}$. Correspondingly, we have two introduction rules:
\begin{align*}
  \prftree[r]{}
    {\prftree[r, noline]{}
      {Γ ⊢ \prop{\mvar{a}}}
      {Γ ⊢ \prop{\mvar{b}}}}
    {Γ ⊢ \mvar{p}:\mvar{a}}
    {Γ ⊢ \apply{\inl}{\mvar{p}}:\mvar{a}\lor\mvar{b}}
  &&\text{and}&&
  \prftree[r]{}
    {\prftree[r, noline]{}
      {Γ ⊢ \prop{\mvar{a}}}
      {Γ ⊢ \prop{\mvar{b}}}}
    {Γ ⊢ \mvar{p}:\mvar{b}}
    {Γ ⊢ \apply{\inr}{\mvar{p}}:\mvar{a}\lor\mvar{b}}.
\end{align*}
The symbol $⊥$ represents falsehood. We say a logic is
\define{consistent}\index{Consistency} if it cannot prove falsehood (a highly
desirable property!). To this end, we have no introduction rule for $⊥$.

What does it mean to know a negation? We'll define
$\lnot\mvar{a}\defeq \mvar{a}→⊥$ and instead worry about when we
know an implication.\footnote{This definition suggests the following ``derived
  introduction rule'' for $⊥$:
  \begin{equation*}
    \prftree[r]{}
      {Γ ⊢ \prop{\mvar{a}}}{Γ ⊢ \mvar{p}:\mvar{a}}{Γ ⊢ \mvar{q}:\lnot\mvar{a}}
      {Γ ⊢ \ttfun{whoops!}(\mvar{p},\mvar{q}):⊥}.
  \end{equation*}
  The derivation of this rule from the elimination rule for $→$
  (\cref{subsec:ipl-elim}) is immediate.}
An implication is true just when we have a hypothetical judgment where the
hypothesis is the antecedent and the conclusion is the consequent. Implication
allows us to \textit{internalize}\index{Internalizing!Hypothetical judgments}
the meta-theoretical notion of hypothetical judgments by turning them into
non-hypothetical ones. To define the introduction rule for $→$, we
assume the presence of a countably-infinite set of \define{variables}
$v,w,\ldots$
\begin{equation*}
  \prftree[r]{}
    {Γ ⊢ \prop{\mvar{a}}}{Γ ⊢ \prop{\mvar{b}}}
    {Γ,\mvar{p}:\mvar{a},Δ⊢ \mvar{q}:\mvar{b}}
    {Γ,Δ⊢\λ{v}{\mvar{q}[\mvar{p}\coloneqq v]}:\mvar{a}→\mvar{b}}.
\end{equation*}

\begin{definition}\label[definition]{def:valid-theorem}
  If know that under no hypotheses $\mvar{a}$ is a proposition and has a proof,
  then we may judge that $\mvar{a}$ is \define{valid}\index{Valid!In
  \IPL{}}:
  \begin{equation*}
    \prftree[r]{}
      {⊢\prop{\mvar{a}}}{⊢\mvar{p}:\mvar{a}}
      {⊢\valid{\mvar{a}}}.
  \end{equation*}
  In this case, we say that $\mvar{a}$ is a \define{theorem}\index{Theorem!Of
  \IPL{}} of \IPL{}.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Elimination rules}
\label{subsec:ipl-elim}

Once we know a judgment, how do we use it in a derivation?
We need \define{elimination rules}. How do we know what they should be?
In a sense to be made precise in \crefrange{subsec:proof-terms}{subsec:ipl-uni},
they should be dual to our introduction rules: we should be able to extract the
same amount of information from a proposition that went into its proof.

For conjunction, we should be able to recover proofs of both conjuncts:
\begin{align*}
  \prftree[r]{}
    {\prftree[r, noline]{}
      {Γ ⊢ \prop{\mvar{a}}}
      {Γ ⊢ \prop{\mvar{b}}}}
    {Γ ⊢ \mvar{p}:\mvar{a}\land\mvar{b}}
    {Γ ⊢ \appr{1}\mvar{p}:\mvar{a}}
  &&\text{and}&&
  \prftree[r]{}
    {\prftree[r, noline]{}
      {Γ ⊢ \prop{\mvar{a}}}
      {Γ ⊢ \prop{\mvar{b}}}}
    {Γ ⊢ \mvar{p}:\mvar{a}\land\mvar{b}}
    {Γ ⊢ \appr{2}\mvar{p}:\mvar{b}}.
\end{align*}
If both disjuncts imply a hypothesis, so does their disjunction:
\begin{align*}
  \prftree[r]{}
    {\prftree[r, noline]{}
      {\prftree[r, noline]{}
        {Γ ⊢ \prop{\mvar{a}}}
        {Γ ⊢ \prop{\mvar{b}}}}
      {Γ ⊢ \prop{\mvar{c}}}}
    {\prftree[r, noline]{}
      {Γ ⊢ \mvar{p}:\mvar{a}→\mvar{c}}
      {Γ ⊢ \mvar{q}:\mvar{b}→\mvar{c}}}
    {Γ ⊢ \mvar{r}:\mvar{a}\lor\mvar{b}}
    {Γ ⊢ \apppply{\case}{\mvar{p}}{\mvar{q}}{\mvar{r}}:\mvar{c}}.
\end{align*}
The elimination rule for implication has the common name
\define{modus ponens}\index{Modus ponens}, and expresses the idea that, if we
had a hypothetical judgment and then come to know all of the hypotheses, we can
deduce the consequence:
\begin{align*}
  \prftree[r]{}
    {Γ ⊢ \prop{\mvar{a}}}{Γ ⊢ \prop{\mvar{b}}}
    {Γ ⊢ \mvar{p}:\mvar{a}→ \mvar{b}}
    {Γ ⊢ \mvar{q}:\mvar{a}}
    {Γ ⊢ \apply{\mvar{p}}{\mvar{q}}:\mvar{b}}.
\end{align*}
The elimination rule for falsehood comes from the principle
\textit{ex falso quod libet}, ``from falsehood anything follows'' (also more
dramatically called the ``principle of explosion''). If we've been
able to prove $⊥$, our whole logic is bankrupt and we can derive anything we
please:
\begin{align*}
  \prftree[r]{}
    {Γ ⊢ \prop{\mvar{a}}}
    {Γ ⊢ \mvar{p}:⊥}
    {Γ ⊢ \apply{\rec_{⊥}}{\mvar{p}}:\mvar{a}}.
\end{align*}

At this point, we'll begin to see some full proofs. Since these quickly become
unmanageably large, we'll implicitly hypothesize that all metavariables involved
represent propositions.

\begin{example}\label[example]{ex:ipl-and-comm}
  The following proves the classical tautology that $\land$ is commutative:
  $\mvar{a}\land\mvar{b}⊢ \mvar{b}\land\mvar{a}$.
  \begin{equation*}
    \prftree[r]{}
      {\prftree[r]{}
        {Γ ⊢ \mvar{p}:\mvar{a}\land\mvar{b}}
        {Γ ⊢ \appr{2}{\mvar{p}}:\mvar{b}}}
      {\prftree[r]{}
        {Γ ⊢ \mvar{p}:\mvar{a}\land\mvar{b}}
        {Γ ⊢ \appr{1}{\mvar{p}}:\mvar{a}}}
      {Γ ⊢ (\appr{2}{\mvar{p}},\appr{1}{\mvar{p}}):\mvar{b}\land\mvar{a}}
  \end{equation*}
  This derivation serves as a small-scale verification that the introduction and
  elimination rules for conjunction complement one another well.
\end{example}

\begin{definition}\label[definition]{def:lem-dne}
  The \define{law of the excluded middle}\index{Law of excluded middle} (from
  the syllogistic principle \textit{tertium non datur}, ``no third is given'')
  is the following rule of deduction:
  \begin{equation*}
    \prftree[r]{\footnotesize LEM}
      {Γ ⊢ \prop{\mvar{a}}}
      {Γ ⊢ \apply{\ttfun{lem}}{\mvar{a}}:\true{\mvar{a}\lor\lnot\mvar{a}}}.
  \end{equation*}
  It is inter-derivable with the rule of \define{double negation elimination}:
  \index{Double negation elimination}
  \begin{equation*}
    \prftree[r]{\footnotesize DNE}
      {Γ ⊢ \prop{\mvar{a}}}{\mvar{p}:\lnot\lnot\mvar{a}}
      {Γ ⊢ \apply{\ttfun{dne}}{\mvar{p}}:\mvar{a}}.
  \end{equation*}
  that is, using the rule LEM, you can construct a proof of DNE and vice versa.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}\label[example]{ex:ipl-not-not-lem}
  A crucial consequence of the definition of \IPL{} is that the law
  of excluded middle isn't a theorem. However, we can demonstrate that
  its negation isn't either. While reading this proof, keep the following in
  mind:
  \begin{itemize}
    \itemsep0em
    \item for brevity, we abbreviate our hypothesis
      $\mvar{h}:\lnot(\mvar{a}\lor\lnot \mvar{a})$ as $\mvar{h}:H$
    \item $\lnot\mvar{a}\equiv \mvar{a}→⊥$

\subsection{Proof terms and harmony}
\label{subsec:proof-terms}

As we can see in \cref{ex:ipl-and-comm}, and \cref{ex:ipl-not-not-lem},
derivations in \IPL{} end with a \define{proof term} which
summarizes the whole proof tree. To demonstrate this, let's attempt to
reconstruct a proof tree based on a judgment including such a term. Suppose your
friend tells you they apprehended the following hypothetical judgment
in a dream, but upon waking, couldn't recall the derivation:
\begin{equation*}
    {Γ ⊢ \apply{\mvar{r}}{(\appr{1}{(\apply{\mvar{p}}{\mvar{q}})})} : \mvar{d}}.
\end{equation*}
Well, it certainly had to end with an application of implication eliimination
to hypotheses of the form $\mvar{b}$ and $\mvar{b}→ \mvar{d}$:
\begin{equation*}
  \prftree[r]{}
    {Γ ⊢ \mvar{r}:\mvar{b}→\mvar{d}}
    {\prftree[r]{}
      {?}
      {Γ ⊢ \appr{1}{(\apply{\mvar{p}}{\mvar{q}})}:\mvar{b}}}
    {Γ ⊢ \apply{\mvar{r}}{(\appr{1}{(\apply{\mvar{p}}{\mvar{q}})})} : \mvar{d}}.
\end{equation*}
and if the term of type $\mvar{b}$ was produced from the application of
$\pr{1}$, the term it was applied to had to be a proof of
$\mvar{b}\land \mvar{c}$ for some $\mvar{c}$:
\begin{equation*}
  \prftree[r]{}
    {Γ ⊢ \mvar{r}:\mvar{b}→\mvar{d}}
    {\prftree[r]{}
      {\prftree[r]{}
        {?}
        {Γ ⊢ \apply{\mvar{p}}{\mvar{q}}:\mvar{b}\land\mvar{c}}}
      {Γ ⊢ \appr{1}{(\apply{\mvar{p}}{\mvar{q}})}:\mvar{b}}}
    {Γ ⊢ \apply{\mvar{r}}{(\appr{1}{(\apply{\mvar{p}}{\mvar{q}})})} : \mvar{d}}.
\end{equation*}
which itself had to be applied to proofs of $\mvar{a}$ and
$\mvar{a}→\mvar{b}\land\mvar{c}$ for some $\mvar{a}$:
\begin{equation*}
  \prftree[r]{}
    {Γ ⊢ \mvar{r}:\mvar{b}→\mvar{d}}
    {\prftree[r]{}
      {\prftree[r]{}
        {Γ ⊢ \mvar{p}:\mvar{a}→(\mvar{b}\land\mvar{c})}
        {Γ ⊢ \mvar{q}:\mvar{a}}
        {Γ ⊢ \apply{\mvar{p}}{\mvar{q}}:\mvar{b}\land\mvar{c}}}
      {Γ ⊢ \appr{1}{(\apply{\mvar{p}}{\mvar{q}})}:\mvar{b}}}
    {Γ ⊢ \apply{\mvar{r}}{(\appr{1}{(\apply{\mvar{p}}{\mvar{q}})})} : \mvar{d}}.
\end{equation*}
At this point, we can (un)deduce no further. The form of the judgment allowed
us no discretion; this is the only derivation (up to\footnote{For the
  non-mathematical reader: When a mathematician says ``X is true up to $R$''
  for some (equivalence) relation $R$, it means that all objects related by $R$
  are considered equivalent. In this case, ``unique up to isomorphism'' means that
  there may be other terminal objects, but all of them are mutually isomorphic.}
renaming of metavariables) that could have produced that conclusion.

The proof term in longer arguments is often cumbersome, and we might wonder if
there are any benefits to internalizing\index{Internalizing!Proofs} proof. The
answer to this question will become clear in
\crefrange{subsec:ipl-compute}{subsec:ipl-uni}, and will play a critical role in
\cref{sec:propositions-and-types}. In short, they will allow us to
verify the \define{harmony}\index{Harmony} of our logic: that the introduction
rules complement the elimination rules with respect to two specific
criteria.\footnote{On the philosophical side, Martin-L\"of made an interesting
  argument that judgments involving proof terms are analytic, whereas
  proof-irrelevant mathematical arguments are synthetic: one must go
  beyond conceptual analysis and view the proof to be convinced of them
  \cite{martin-lof-analytic}.}

\begin{definition}\label[definition]{def:local-soundness-completeness}
  \define{Local soundness}\index{Soundness!Local} is the condition that
  elimination rules can't extract more information than was put into a
  conclusion by introduction rules; they aren't too strong.

  \define{Local completeness}\index{Completeness!Local} is the condition that
  elimination rules can recover all the information that was put into a conclusion
  by introduction rules; they aren't too weak.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Computation rules and judgmental equality}
\label{subsec:ipl-compute}

Some proofs are needlessly roundabout, and can be shortened.
Consider:
\begin{equation*}
  {\prftree[r]{}
    {\prftree[r]{}
      {Γ ⊢ \mvar{p}:\mvar{a}}
      {Γ ⊢ \mvar{q}:\mvar{b}}
      {Γ ⊢ (\mvar{p},\mvar{q}):\mvar{a}\land\mvar{b}}}
    {Γ ⊢ \appr{1}{(\mvar{p},\mvar{q})}:\mvar{a}}}.
\end{equation*}
This derivation could be eliminated entirely: we had a proof of $\mvar{a}$ to
begin with! This is an instance of a general pattern: whenever we have an
elimination rule for a connective just after its introduction, we can avoid the
circumlocution and cut straight to the conclusion.

Do such shortcuts result in \textit{the same} proof? To phrase this
question precisely, one needs a notion of identity for proof terms.
This notion is constructed just so we can answer this question in the
affirmative.

\begin{definition}\label[definition]{def:jdeq-ipl}
	\define{Judgmental equality} of proof terms, denoted
  $\mvar{p}\jdeq\mvar{q}:mvar{a}$, is the least congruence closed under the
  following
  \define{computation rules}\index{Computation rules!In \IPL{}}
  (also called \define{β-rules}):
  \begin{gatherjot}
    {\prftree[r]{\footnotesize β$∧$\textsubscript{l}}
      {Γ ⊢ \mvar{p}:\mvar{a}}{\mvar{q}:\mvar{b}}
      {Γ ⊢ \appr{1}{(\mvar{p},\mvar{q})}\jdeq \mvar{p}:\mvar{a}}}
    \qquad
    {\prftree[r]{\footnotesize β$∧$\textsubscript{r}}
      {Γ ⊢ \mvar{p}:\mvar{a}}{\mvar{q}:\mvar{b}}
      {Γ ⊢ \appr{2}{(\mvar{p},\mvar{q})} \jdeq \mvar{q}:\mvar{b}}} \\
    {\prftree[r]{\footnotesize β$→$}
      {Γ, \mvar{p}:\mvar{a}⊢\mvar{q}:\mvar{b}}
      {Γ ⊢ \mvar{r}:\mvar{a}}
      {Γ ⊢ \apply{(\λ{v}\mvar{q})}{\mvar{r}}\jdeq
        \mvar{q}[\mvar{p}\coloneqq\mvar{r}]:\mvar{b}}} \\
    {\prftree[r]{\footnotesize β$∨$\textsubscript{l}}
      {\prftree[r, noline]{}
        {Γ ⊢ \mvar{p}:\mvar{a}→\mvar{c}}
        {Γ ⊢ \mvar{q}:\mvar{b}→\mvar{c}}}
      {Γ ⊢ \mvar{r}:\mvar{a}}
      {Γ ⊢ \apppply{\case}{\mvar{p}}{\mvar{q}}{(\apply{\inl}{\mvar{r}})}\jdeq
        \apply{\mvar{p}}{\mvar{r}}:\mvar{c}}}
    \qquad
    {\prftree[r]{\footnotesize β$∨$\textsubscript{r}}
      {\prftree[r, noline]{}
        {Γ ⊢ \mvar{p}:\mvar{a}→\mvar{c}}
        {Γ ⊢ \mvar{q}:\mvar{b}→\mvar{c}}}
      {Γ ⊢ \mvar{r}:\mvar{b}}
      {Γ ⊢ \apppply{\case}{\mvar{p}}{\mvar{q}}{(\apply{\inr}{\mvar{r}})}\jdeq
        \apply{\mvar{q}}{\mvar{r}}:\mvar{c}}}.
  \end{gatherjot}
  (Recall \cref{notation:substitution} for the meaning of
  $\mvar{q}[\mvar{p}\coloneqq\mvar{r}]$).\footnote{
    Since the elimination rule for falsehood (\cref{subsec:ipl-elim}) gives back a
    proof of an arbitrary proposition (which is not in general one of the ``inputs''
    to falsehood introduction), there's no corresponding β-rule.}
\end{definition}

Besides allowing us to write shorter proofs, these rules witness local
soundness; they show that the elimination rules never prove any conclusion that
wasn't given to an introduction rule.

\subsection{Unicity rules}
\label{subsec:ipl-uni}

% Just because a logic doesn't give us an easy way to do something unexpected
% doesn't mean it can't be done. The prime example is proving a contradiction.
% History is filled with deductive systems that were thought to be sound, but
% were shown to be useless by some clever argument. Russell's paradox dispensed
% with Frege's \textit{Begriffsschrift}, the Burali-Forti antimony unraveled
% na\"ive set theories, and Girard's paradox revealed a fatal flaw in
% Martin-L\"of's early attempts at dependent type theory.

One worry we might have when designing our logic is that our propositions have
proofs of a non-standard form. We might \textit{think} that every proof of
$\mvar{a}∧\mvar{b}$ has the form $(\mvar{p},\mvar{q})$ for $\mvar{p}:\mvar{a}$ and
$\mvar{q}:\mvar{b}$, but how do we \textit{know}? The answer was is in
following \define{unicity rules}\index{Unicity rules}, (also known as
\define{η-rules} or \define{uniqueness principles}):
\begin{gatherjot}
  {\prftree[r]{\footnotesize η$⊤$}
    {Γ ⊢ \mvar{p}:⊤}
    {Γ ⊢ \mvar{p}\jdeq \unitelem : ⊤}}
  \qquad
  {\prftree[r]{\footnotesize η$∧$}
    {Γ ⊢ \mvar{p}:\mvar{a}∧\mvar{b}}
    {Γ ⊢ (\appr{1}{\mvar{p}},\appr{2}{\mvar{p}})\jdeq
      \mvar{p}:\mvar{a}∧\mvar{b}}} \\
  {\prftree[r]{\footnotesize η$→$}
    {Γ ⊢ \mvar{p}:\mvar{a}→\mvar{b}}
    {Γ ⊢ \λ{v}{(\apply{\mvar{p}}{v})}\jdeq \mvar{p}:\mvar{a}→\mvar{b}}}
  \qquad
  {\prftree[r]{\footnotesize η$∨$}
    {Γ ⊢ \mvar{p}:\mvar{a}∨\mvar{b}}
    {Γ ⊢ \apppply{\case}{\inl}{\inr}{\mvar{p}}\jdeq \mvar{p}:\mvar{a}∨\mvar{b}}}.
\end{gatherjot}
Naturally, these rules witness local completeness; after applying elimination
rules and then introduction rules we can recover our original proofs.

\subsection{Diagrams}
\label{subsec:ipl-diagrams}

One of the ways that we can understand our computation rules is via a clever
sort of diagram. This section foreshadows some connections between
\IPL{} and the content of \cref{chap:category-theory}.

\begin{definition}\label[definition]{def:implication-composition}
  Suppose given terms $\mvar{p}:\mvar{a}→\mvar{b}$ and
  $\mvar{q}:\mvar{b}→\mvar{c}$ under some hypotheses $\Gamma$. We define the
  \define{composition}\index{Composition!Of proof terms}
  $\mvar{q}∘\mvar{p}:\mvar{a}→\mvar{c}$ to be the term in the conclusion of the
  following deduction:
  \begin{equation*}
  {\prftree[r]{}
    {\prftree[r]{}
      {\prftree[r]{}
        {\prftree[r]{\footnotesize refl}
          {}
          {Γ, \mvar{r}:\mvar{a} ⊢ \mvar{r}:\mvar{a}}}
        {\prftree[r]{\footnotesize weak}
          {Γ ⊢ \mvar{p}:\mvar{a}→\mvar{b}}
          {Γ, \mvar{r}:\mvar{a} ⊢ \mvar{p}:\mvar{a}→\mvar{b}}}
        {Γ, \mvar{r}:\mvar{a} ⊢ \apply{\mvar{p}}{\mvar{r}}:\mvar{b}}}
      {\prftree[r]{\footnotesize weak}
        {Γ ⊢ \mvar{q}:\mvar{b}→\mvar{c}}
        {Γ, \mvar{r}:\mvar{a} ⊢ \mvar{q}:\mvar{b}→\mvar{c}}}
      {Γ, \mvar{r}:\mvar{a} ⊢ \apply{\mvar{q}}{(\apply{\mvar{p}}{\mvar{r}})}:\mvar{c}}}
    {Γ ⊢ \λ{v}{\apply{\mvar{q}}{(\apply{\mvar{p}}{v}})}:\mvar{a}→\mvar{c}}}.
  \end{equation*}
  In short, $\mvar{q}∘\mvar{p}\defeq \λ{v}{\apply{\mvar{q}}{(\apply{\mvar{p}}{v}})}$.
\end{definition}

Now suppose we have terms $\mvar{p}:\mvar{a}→\mvar{c}$ and
$\mvar{q}:\mvar{b}→\mvar{c}$. Via the elimination rule for $∨$, there is a
term $\apppply{\case}{\mvar{p}}{\mvar{q}}:\mvar{a}∨\mvar{b}→\mvar{c}$.
We can rewrite the β-rules using the composition we just defined:
\begin{align*}
  \appply{\case}{\mvar{p}}{\mvar{q}}∘\inl &\jdeq \mvar{p} \\
  \appply{\case}{\mvar{p}}{\mvar{q}}∘\inr &\jdeq \mvar{q}
\end{align*}
Similarly, given $\mvar{p}:\mvar{c}→\mvar{a}$ and $\mvar{q}:\mvar{c}→\mvar{b}$,
the introduction rule for $∧$ guarantees a function
$\mvar{f}\defeq\lam{v}{(\apply{\mvar{p}}{v}, \apply{\mvar{q}}{v})}:\mvar{c}→\mvar{a}∧\mvar{b}$.
The computation rules give us the following equalities:
\begin{align*}
  \pr{1}∘f &\jdeq \mvar{p} \\
  \pr{2}∘f &\jdeq \mvar{q}
\end{align*}
We can express these equalities using the following \define{commutative diagram}
(skip ahead to \cref{def:commutative-diagram} for details).

% Now suppose we have another term $\mvar{r}:\mvar{a}∨\mvar{b}→\mvar{c}$ which
% obeys the same equalities,
% \begin{align*}
%   \mvar{r}∘\inl &\jdeq \mvar{p} \\
%   \mvar{r}∘\inr &\jdeq \mvar{q}
% \end{align*}

% \begin{lemma}
% 	For any $\mvar{f}:\mvar{c}→\mvar{d}$,
%   \begin{equation*}

% \end{lemma}
% \begin{proof}
% 	\begin{align*}

  \end{minipage}
\end{center}
In short, each of the two respective computation rules ensure that, whichever
(directed) path you take around the perimeters of the two triangles, composing
as you go, you get judgmentally equal results.

\section{The λ-calculus}
\label{sec:the-lambda-calculus}

In the 1930s, mathematicians and computer scientists (though they were not
called ``computer scientists'' then) sought a rigorous foundation for terms like
``effectively computable'' and ``systematic''. They sought to lay on a rigorous
logical foundation an intuitive idea of what a(n idealized) human being could
accomplish with specific\footnote{(finite)} instructions and arbitrarily much
paper, pen, and time. Many particular mathematical models were proposed,
including the λ-calculus (\LC{}), Turing machines, Post systems,
register machines, combinatory definability, and more \cite{sep-church-turing}.
The \textit{Church-Turing thesis} proposes that the proper definition is (any
model equivalent to) the λ-calculus.\footnote{Perhaps the strongest reason to
  accept such a thesis is the theorem that all models just mentioned are
  equivalent.}
Computer scientists widely adopt this thesis, and the λ-calculus and its
variants are of central importance to the study of computation in
general.

A comprehensive study of \LC{} is beyond the scope
of this thesis. For a tutorial on \LC{} and \STLC{} to
complement the presentation here, see \cite{lambda-lecture}. For a standard
reference on \LC{} (with an appendix on \STLC{}), see
\cite{barendregt}.

The type theory considered in \cref{chap:type-theory} is an extension of the
typed λ-calculus (\TLC{}) of \cref{subsec:more-complex-types}, which
itself an extension of the simply-typed λ-calculus (\STLC{}) of
\cref{subsec:the-simply-typed-lambda-calculus}.

\subsection{The untyped λ-calculus}
\label{subsec:the-untyped-lambda-calculus}

The formation\index{Formation!In the λ-calculus} (really, all) rules of the
λ-calculus are brilliantly simple.\footnote{Again, ignoring issues of variable
binding.} We will again assume the presence of a countably infinite set of
variables $v,w,\ldots$:
\begin{align*}
  {\prftree[r]{}
    {}
    {Γ ⊢ \term{v}}}
  &&
  {\prftree[r]{}
    {Γ ⊢ \term{\mvar{a}}}
    {Γ ⊢ \term{\mvar{b}}}
    {Γ ⊢ \term{\apply{\mvar{a}}{\mvar{b}}}}}
  &&
  {\prftree[r]{}
    {Γ ⊢ \mvar{a}}
    {Γ ⊢ \term{\lam{v}{\mvar{a}}}}}
\end{align*}
In short, we have variables, application of one term to another, and
\define{function abstraction}. The λ-calculus is the inspiration for our
notation of function application by juxtaposition (\cref{notation:parens}).
Accordingly, function application is left-associative.

There are no elimination rules. Again, we define judgmental equality λ-terms to
be the least congruence closed under the following computation
rule\index{Computation rules!In \LC{}} and subject to the following
unicity rule:
\begin{align*}
  {\prftree[r]{\footnotesize β}
    {Γ ⊢ \term{\mvar{a}}}
    {Γ ⊢ \term{\mvar{b}}}
    {Γ ⊢ \apply{(\λ{v}\mvar{a})}{\mvar{b}}\jdeq
      \mvar{a}[v\coloneqq\mvar{b}]}}
  &&
  {\prftree[r]{\footnotesize η}
    {Γ ⊢ \term{\mvar{a}}}
    {Γ ⊢ \λ{v}{(\apply{\mvar{a}}{v})}\jdeq \mvar{a}}}.
\end{align*}

\begin{notation}\label[notation]{notation:beta}
  If we apply the computation rule to $\mvar{a}$ and get some term $\mvar{a}'$,
  we write $\mvar{a} \betato \mvar{a}'$. If we apply it an arbitrary but finite
  (possibly zero) amount of times to get $\mvar{a}''$, we write $\mvar{a}
  \betatoo \mvar{a}''$.
\end{notation}

\begin{example*}\label[example]{ex:calculations-in-lc}
  Under the computation rule, we have
  \begin{align*}
    &\appply
      {(\λ{u}{\λ{v}{\λ{w}{\appply{\mvar{x}}{v}{w}}}})}
      {(\λ{y}{y})}
      {(\λ{z}{\apply{z}{\mvar{a}}})} \\
    \≡ &\apply
      {(\λ{v}{\λ{w}{\appply{\mvar{x}}{v}{w}}})[u\≔ (\λ{y}{y})]}
      {(\λ{z}{\apply{z}{\mvar{a}}})}
    &&\quad\text{(β)} \\
    \≡ &\apply
      {(\λ{v}{\λ{w}{\appply{\mvar{x}}{v}{w}}})}
      {(\λ{z}{\apply{z}{\mvar{a}}})}
    &&\quad\text{(substitution)} \\
    \≡ & (\λ{w}{\appply{\mvar{x}}{v}{w}})[v\≔ \λ{z}{\apply{z}{\mvar{a}}}]
    &&\quad\text{(β)} \\
    \≡ & (\λ{w}{\appply{\mvar{x}}{(\λ{z}{\apply{z}{\mvar{a}}})}{w}})
    &&\quad\text{(substitution)}.
  \end{align*}
  (Recall the meta-theoretical notation $\mvar{a}[\mvar{b} \≔ \mvar{c}]$,
  \cref{notation:substitution}.)
  Since $\mvar{x}$ is some arbitrary term, we can reduce this expression no
  further.
\end{example*}

\begin{example*}\label[example]{ex:fixed-point}
  A \define{fixed point} of a function $f$ (in \LC{},
  \FOL+\ZFC, or any other formal system or programming language)
  is an input $x$ such that $\apply{f}{x}=x$. Every term of \LC{}
  has a fixed point (up to judgmental equality $\≡$). To see this, define
  $θ \defeq (\λ{x}{\λ{y}{\apply{y}{(\appply{x}{x}{y})}}})$ and let
  $𝚯\defeq \apply{θ}{θ}$. Let $\mvar{f}$ be any term of \LC{}. Then
  \begin{align*}
    \apply{𝚯}{f}
    &\≡ \appply{θ}{θ}{f} \\
    &\≡ \appply{(\λ{x}{\λ{y}{\apply{y}{(\appply{x}{x}{y})}}})}{θ}{f} \\
    &\≡ \apply{f}{(\appply{θ}{θ}{f})} \\
    &\≡ \apply{f}{(\apply{𝚯}{f})}
  \end{align*}
  The term $𝚯$ is called the \define{Turing fixed-point combinator}, and it can
  be used to define recursive functions in \LC{} and its derivatives
  \cite{lambda-lecture}.
\end{example*}

We can make choices about what part of an expression to apply the computation
rule to. Consider the following computations:
\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzpicture}[node distance=1.5cm]
    \node[] (A) at (0, 0) {$

    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% LAST
    \node[below of=A, yshift=-13em] (Z) {$

  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
In the left column, we reduce the leftmost expression first, whereas in the
right column, we reduce the rightmost expression first. In this example, they
result in the same term, but there is \textit{a priori} no reason to think this
is so in general.

\begin{theorem}[Church-Rosser]\label[theorem]{thm:church-rosser}
  The order in which we apply computation rules to a term of \LC{}
  doesn't matter. More specifically, if $\mvar{a}\betatoo\mvar{b}$ and
  $\mvar{a}\betatoo\mvar{c}$, then there is a term $\mvar{d}$ such that
  $\mvar{b}\betatoo\mvar{d}$ and $\mvar{c}\betatoo \mvar{d}$.
  Diagrammatically,
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzcd}[sep=small, every arrow/.append style={two heads, "β"}]
      {} &
      \mvar{a}
        \arrow[dl, swap]
        \arrow[dr] &
      {} \\
      \mvar{b}
        \arrow[dr, dashed, swap] &
      {} &
      \mvar{c}
        \arrow[dl, dashed] \\
      {} & \mvar{d} & {}
    \end{tikzcd}
  \end{center}
\end{theorem}

Note that the Church-Rosser Theorem doesn't claim judgmental equality
$\≡$,\footnote{If it did, it would be trivial; the β-rules preserve judgmental
equality.} but actual \textit{syntactic identity}, they compute to the exact
same term.

\begin{definition}\label[definition]{def:normal-form}
	If $\mvar{a}$ is a term of \LC{} such that there does not exist
  a term $\mvar{a}'$ with $\mvar{a}\betato \mvar{a}'$, then we say that
  $\mvar{a}$ is in \define{(β-)normal form}\index{Normal form}.
  If $\mvar{b}\betatoo\mvar{b}'$ and $\mvar{b}'$ is in normal form, we say
  $\mvar{b}'$ is the normal form of $\mvar{b}$.
\end{definition}

The use of the definite article in \cref{def:normal-form} is justified by
Church-Rosser: every term has at most one β-normal form. However, not every
term has a β-normal form.

\begin{example*}\label[example]{ex:non-terminating}
  Consider the term $⊥\≔ \λ{v}{\appply{v}{v}{v}}$. Using the computation rule,
  \begin{align*}
    \apply{⊥}{⊥}
    &\≡ \apply{(\λ{v}{\appply{v}{v}{v}})}{⊥}
    &&\quad\text{(Definition)} \\
    &\≡ (\appply{v}{v}{v})[v \defeq ⊥]
    &&\quad\text{(β)} \\
    &\≡ \appply{⊥}{⊥}{⊥}
    &&\quad\text{(Substitution)} \\
    &\≡ \apppply{⊥}{⊥}{⊥}{⊥}
    &&\quad\text{(…)} \\
    &\≡ \appppply{⊥}{⊥}{⊥}{⊥}{⊥} \\
    &\≡ ⋯
  \end{align*}
  Not only can we build terms that don't really ``progress'' when we try to
  ``compute'', but we can build terms that actually \textit{expand} under rules
  meant to \textit{reduce} them, that are judgmentally equal to infinitely many
  other terms!
\end{example*}

While an ability to loop indefinitely is essential to Turing-Completeness (the
property of being equivalent to a Turing machine model of computation), we
might ask if there is another system in which we could express many of the same
ideas and computations, but with a computation rule that always ``terminates''.

\subsection{The simply-typed λ-calculus}
\label{subsec:the-simply-typed-lambda-calculus}

In order to fix the problem raised in \cref{ex:non-terminating}, we can add
\define{types}\index{Types!Simply-typed λ-calculus} to \LC{} to get
\STLC{}, the simply-typed λ-calculus. We consider two new judgments
of the form ``$\type{\mvar{t}}$'' and ``$\mvar{a}:\mvar{t}$'', read
``\mvar{t} is a type'' and ``\mvar{a} has type \mvar{t}'', respectively (recall
that ``$:$'' is a symbol of the meta-language, it is just shorthand for writing
a judgment). In writing these judgments, we implicitly assume that all
expressions are well-formed terms. As a first approximation, a type can be
thought of as a description of a program's behavior.

This language begins with additional formation rules
\begin{align*}
  {\prftree[r]{}
    {}
    {Γ ⊢ \type{\groundtype_i}}}
  &&
  {\prftree[r]{}
    {Γ ⊢ \type{\mvar{s}}}
    {Γ ⊢ \type{\mvar{t}}}
    {Γ ⊢ \type{\mvar{s}→\mvar{t}}}}
\end{align*}
The $\groundtype_i$ are called \define{ground types}, \define{base types}, or
\define{atomic types}.\footnote{There can be as many ground types as necessary
  or only one, it doesn't fundamentally change the character of the resulting
  theory.}
The term $\mvar{a}→\mvar{b}$ is the type of functions from $\mvar{a}$ to
$\mvar{b}$. The introduction
rule\index{Introduction rules!In \STLC{}} tells us how to form
elements of these types:
\begin{align*}
  {\prftree[r]{}
    {Γ, \mvar{a}:\mvar{s} ⊢ \mvar{b}:\mvar{t}}
    {Γ ⊢ \λ{v}{\mvar{b}}:\mvar{s}→\mvar{t}}}
    % {Γ ⊢ \λ{v}{\mvar{b}}[\mvar{a}\defeq v]:\mvar{s}→\mvar{t}}}
\end{align*}
Introduction rules for some ground type(s) are reasonable additional axioms, but
they are not necessary for the development of the theory.\footnote{This might
look like
\begin{align*}
  {\prftree[r]{}
    {}
    {Γ ⊢ z:\groundtype_0}}.
\end{align*}
which would assert the existence of an element $z$ of the 0\textsuperscript{th}
ground type $\groundtype_0$.
} An elimination rule balances this introduction:
\begin{align*}
  {\prftree[r]{}
    {Γ ⊢ \mvar{a}:\mvar{s}→\mvar{t}}
    {Γ ⊢ \mvar{b}:\mvar{s}}
    {Γ ⊢ \apply{\mvar{a}}{\mvar{b}}:\mvar{t}}}
\end{align*}
The computation rules\index{Computation rules!In \STLC{}} and
unicity rules remain much the same, only now with some restrictions on the types
of the expressions involved:
\begin{align*}
  {\prftree[r]{\footnotesize β}
    {Γ, \mvar{a}:\mvar{s} ⊢ \mvar{b}:\mvar{t}}
    {Γ ⊢ \mvar{c}:\mvar{s}}
    {Γ ⊢ \apply{(\λ{v}\mvar{b})}{\mvar{c}}\jdeq
      \mvar{b}[\mvar{a}\coloneqq\mvar{c}]}}
  &&
  {\prftree[r]{\footnotesize η}
    {Γ ⊢ \term{\mvar{a}}}
    {Γ ⊢ \λ{v}{(\apply{\mvar{a}}{v})}\jdeq \mvar{a}}}.
\end{align*}
Variables may stand in for terms of arbitrary type.

\begin{theorem}\label[theorem]{thm:strong-normalization}
  \STLC{} is \define{strongly normalizing}; every term has exactly
  one normal form.
\end{theorem}

\begin{example}
	Recall the problematic term of \cref{ex:non-terminating}:
  $⊥\≔ \λ{v}{\apply{v}{v}}$. Can the introduction rules assign this term a type?
  To determine the overall type of $⊥$, we must determine the type of its
  argument. Its argument gets applied to a term, so it must have a function type
  $\mvar{a} → \mvar{b}$. However, since it is applied to
  itself, it must have type $(\mvar{a} → \mvar{b}) → \mvar{b}$. But now it still
  can't be applied to itself, so it must have type
  $((\mvar{a} → \mvar{b}) → \mvar{b}) → \mvar{b}$. Of course, this problem
  persists no matter how many layers are added, and leads us to the following
  conclusion: no well-typed term may be applied to itself.
\end{example}

\subsection{More complex types}
\label{subsec:more-complex-types}

The ontology of \STLC{} is severely limited: it can only express
ground type(s) and functions between them. This section develops
various \define{type formers}, which build up more complex types
from simpler ones (e.g.\ $→$ from \STLC{}). In
\cref{sec:propositions-and-types}, we will see that these types conform to
intuitions from \cref{sec:ipl}.

We will specifically consider four additional types (plus $→$), formed via the
following rules\index{Formation rules!In \TLC{}}:
\begin{gatherjot}
  \prftree[r]{}{}{Γ⊢\type{⊤}}
  \qquad
  \prftree[r]{}{}{Γ⊢\type{⊥}}
  \qquad
  \prftree[r]{}
    {\prftree[r, noline]{}
      {Γ ⊢ \type{\mvar{a}}}
      {Γ ⊢ \type{\mvar{b}}}}
    {Γ⊢\type{\mvar{a}×\mvar{b}}}
  \qquad
  \prftree[r]{}
    {\prftree[r, noline]{}
      {Γ ⊢ \type{\mvar{a}}}
      {Γ ⊢ \type{\mvar{b}}}}
    {Γ⊢\type{\mvar{a}+\mvar{b}}}
\end{gatherjot}

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the type $⊥$ is empty, it has no elements.
The type $⊤$ has one element:\footnote{This rule only really says we have one
  known way to construct an element of $⊤$, but the η-rules for this type
  justify the claim that this is the only such element.}
\begin{equation*}
  \prftree[r]{}{}{Γ ⊢ \unitelem:⊤}.
\end{equation*}
The type $\mvar{a}×\mvar{b}$ contains (ordered) pairs, with one element from
$\mvar{a}$ and one from $\mvar{b}$:
\begin{equation*}
  \prftree[r]{}
    {Γ ⊢ \prop{\mvar{a}}}{Γ ⊢ \prop{\mvar{b}}}
    {Γ ⊢ \mvar{p}:\mvar{a}}{Γ ⊢ \mvar{q}:\mvar{b}}
    {Γ ⊢ (\mvar{p},\mvar{q}):\mvar{a}×\mvar{b}}.
\end{equation*}
The type $\mvar{a}+\mvar{b}$ is sometimes called ``option'' or ``either'': it
contains tagged elements of $\mvar{a}$ or $\mvar{b}$:
\begin{align*}
  \prftree[r]{}
    {\prftree[r, noline]{}
      {Γ ⊢ \prop{\mvar{a}}}
      {Γ ⊢ \prop{\mvar{b}}}}
    {Γ ⊢ \mvar{p}:\mvar{a}}
    {Γ ⊢ \apply{\inl}{\mvar{p}}:\mvar{a}+\mvar{b}},
  &&
  \prftree[r]{}
    {\prftree[r, noline]{}
      {Γ ⊢ \prop{\mvar{a}}}
      {Γ ⊢ \prop{\mvar{b}}}}
    {Γ ⊢ \mvar{p}:\mvar{b}}
    {Γ ⊢ \apply{\inr}{\mvar{p}}:\mvar{a}+\mvar{b}}.
\end{align*}

The elimination rules\index{Elimination rules!In \TLC{}}
act as one might expect, given the reuse of the notation from \cref{sec:ipl} for
the introduction rules:

Just as with the formation, introduction, and elimination rules,
the computation and unicity rules are identical to those in \IPL{}
(modulo notational differences), and so are omitted here.

Examples of (somewhat) practical programs that can be written in an extension
of this theory abound in \cref{chap:type-theory}.

\subsection{Propositions and Types}
\label{sec:propositions-and-types}

What just happened? \Cref{sec:ipl} defined a logico-deductive system, capable of
expressing many familiar proofs of sentential logic (with some differences
stemming from its constructivist nature). \Cref{sec:the-lambda-calculus} took a
sharp left turn, describing a formalism for capturing a notion of algorithmic
computability. However, the system obtained by adding a few reasonable features
for describing more complicated data to \STLC{} looked not merely
analogous, but \textit{identical to} \IPL{} (again, modulo simple
notational changes, see \cref{tab:curry-howard}).

While perhaps less surprising due to the notational conveniences of hindsight,
this observation has startling and deep consequences (and a rich intellectual
history). It is known as the
Curry-Howard(-Lambek)\footnote{More on Lambek's part in \cref{rmk:lambek}}
correspondence, or the propositions-as-types interpretation. First investigated
by Curry \cite{curry-howard}, who noticed that the types of the ``combinators''
of his computational system\footnote{Equivalent to the λ-calculus, of course}
could be interpreted as valid propositions in \IPL{}. This
observation squared nicely with what's called the Brouwer-Heyting-Kolmogorov
interpretation of \IPL{}, which asserts that the semantics thereof
are to be interpreted as referring not exactly to propositions and their proofs,
but more general ``problems'' and their ``solutions'' \cite{kolmogorov}.

So what does this correspondence really say? It can be understood in many
ways.\footnote{Read in a particular light, the univalence principle
  \cref{sec:univalence} might suggest that this ``isomorphism'' be read
  as an \textit{identity}, an expression of the fundamental sameness of logic
  and computation.}
It says that \TLC{} can be used to provide semantics for programming
languages \cite{landin}. It says that proofs of \IPL{} can be
encoded into \TLC{}. This translation has the nice property that
type-checking (the process of determining whether or not has a given type in a
given context $Γ$) is decidable: it can be performed mechanically, preferably by
a computer. This gives such proofs a strong epistemological footing.

\chapter{Type theory}
\label{chap:type-theory}

Whatever the meaning of the Curry-Howard correspondence, its utility is
circumscribed by the fact that \IPL{}/\TLC{} as
presented do not match the expressive power of classical \FOL:
there are no types expressing quantification over some domain, nor propositions
or relations that may ``apply'' to terms and variables. Certainly, they are
missing the infinite structures of classical set theory.

The system described in this section enriches \TLC{} with
\textit{dependent types} (\cref{sec:dependent-types}) and a few more base types,
including our first examples of \textit{inductive types}
(\cref{subsec:natural-numbers-and-lists}). Additionally, we define and include
Voevodsky's univalence axiom (\cref{sec:univalence}). The
resulting system (univalent type theory, or \UTT{}) has similar
expressive power to \ZFC+\FOL.\footnote{Indeed, the
  ``set types'' (\cref{def:sets}) behave very much like sets in classical
  mathematics, especially when a few classically-minded axioms are assumed. See
  \cite{book} for more commentary.}

\UTT{} mirrors the type theory $\caH'$ of \cite{homotopy-limits}, which itself
is the system $\caH$ in \cite{inductive} and \cite{homotopy-initial} with the
addition of the natural numbers and a universe. The results of
\cref{chap:coinductive-types-in-univalent-type-theory} don't
require the full power of homotopy type theory (\HoTT), specifically we leave
out the axioms asserting the existence of higher inductive types.

\section{Dependent types}
\label{sec:dependent-types}

One of the slogans of dependently typed programming is that \textit{types are
terms}. Propositions, like proof terms, can now be subsumed as objects of study
in their own right. However, all terms must have a type. What, if anything, is
the type of types?

\begin{definition}\label[definition]{def:universes}
  All the base types we have considered up to this point ($⊤$, $⊥$) are members
  of a \define{universe} \universei{0}, formed via the following rule:
  \begin{equation*}
    \prftree[r]{}
      {}
      {Γ⊢\type{\universei{0}}}
  \end{equation*}
  The type formers $×$, $+$, and $→$
  preserve membership of this universe, i.e.\
  \begin{gatherjot}
    \prftree[r]{}{}{Γ⊢⊤:\universei{0}}
    \qquad
    \prftree[r]{}{}{Γ⊢⊥:\universei{0}}
    \qquad
    \prftree[r]{}
      {\prftree[r, noline]{}
        {Γ ⊢ \mvar{a}:\universei{0}}
        {Γ ⊢ \mvar{b}:\universei{0}}}
      {Γ⊢\mvar{a}×\mvar{b}:\universei{0}}
    \qquad
    \prftree[r]{}
      {\prftree[r, noline]{}
        {Γ ⊢ \mvar{a}:\universei{0}}
        {Γ ⊢ \mvar{b}:\universei{0}}}
      {Γ⊢\mvar{a}+\mvar{b}:\universei{0}}
  \end{gatherjot}
  Conversely, if something is a member of the universe, we may conclude that
  it is a type:
  \begin{equation*}
    \prftree[r]{}
      {Γ ⊢ \mvar{a}:\universei{0}}
      {Γ⊢\type{\mvar{a}}}
  \end{equation*}
\end{definition}

Dependent types blur (well, destroy) the distinction between what goes
on the left- and right-hand side of the typing judgment (``$:$'').
Additional commentary on the universe follows in \cref{rmk:universe-hierarchy}.

\subsection{Π-types}
\label{subsec:pi-types}

We now have the power to write an \textit{single} identity function that works
for \textit{all} types.

\begin{definition}\label[definition]{def:id-polymorphic}
  The identity function is
	\begin{align*}
    \id :\∏{A:\universe}{A\to A} &&
    \id \defeq \λ{A}{\λ{a}{a}}
  \end{align*}
\end{definition}

\begin{notation}\label[notation]{implicit-args}
  Often in type theory, functions have ``extraneous'' arguments,
  meaning their values can be deduced from context. For instance, 
  in the (not wellformed) expression $\appply{\id}{\_}{a}$ for $a:A$, the only
  value that can go in the blank is (something judgmentally equal to)
  $A$.\footnote{In \Coq{}, one may actually write $\_$ in place of an
  argument and it will be filled in by a component called the \textit{unifier},
  or declare once and for all that such an argument never needs to be filled in
  when calling the function (such arguments are called \textit{implicit}).}

  As another example, an inhabitant of the following type witnesses the
  associativity of function composition:
  \begin{equation*}
    \∏{A,B,C,D:\universe}{
      \∏{f:A→B}{
        \∏{g:B→C}{
          \∏{h:C→D}{
            \propeq{}{(h∘g)∘f}{h∘(g∘f)}
    }}}}.\footnote{By the way, this identity is witnessed by reflexivity. To
    convince yourself that this is so, recall \cref{def:implication-composition}.}
  \end{equation*}
  However, the arguments $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ can be inferred from the types
  of $f$, $g$, and $h$. In the remainder of this thesis, such arguments may be
  written as subscripts or left out entirely.

\subsection{Natural numbers and lists}
\label{subsec:natural-numbers-and-lists}

\subsubsection{On the law of the excluded middle}
\label{subsec:on-lem}

\TODO{introduce the topic based on previous sections}

Consider functions with the following types:
\begin{itemize}
  \itemsep0em
  \item $\ttfun{dne}:\∏{A:\universe}{((A\to⊥)\to⊥)\to A}$
  \item $\ttfun{lem}:\∏{A:\universe}{A+(A\to⊥)}$
\end{itemize}
What can we tell about these functions from their type signatures?
The term $\ttfun{dne}$ takes as argument a term $x:(A\to⊥)\to⊥$,
that is, a term showing that $A$ is not the empty type\footnote{More precisely,
  $x$ demonstrates that $A$ is not \textit{isomorphic} or \textit{equivalent} to
  $⊥$, in the sense of \cref{subsec:weak-equivalences}. If $A$ were isomorphic
  to $⊥$, then that isomorphism would be an inhabitant of $A\to⊥$.}, and
produces some element of $A$. This seems like a very tricky function to write:
how can we give a term of type $A$ just by knowing $A$ has terms? We don't
know what form data of type $A$ have! The function $\ttfun{lem}$ seems
similarly quagmired. Given a type $A$, this function either has to produce an
element of it, or demonstrate that it is uninhabited.

As you may have already guessed, under the propositions/types correspondence,
these functions correspond to the rule of double negation elimination
($\ttfun{dne}$)\index{Double negation elimination}
and the law of excluded middle ($\ttfun{lem}$)\index{Law of excluded middle}
\cref{def:lem-dne}.

To demonstrate with finality that these are not definable terms in any
consistent type theory, consider the application of $\ttfun{lem}$ to a type
$\ttfun{pnp}$ that corresponds to the $\textsc{P}\neq\textsc{NP}$ conjecture
under the types-as-propositions interpretation. If $\ttfun{lem}$ existed, we
could trivially solve this problem and make a million dollars! We need no
recourse to philosophy to justify the constructive/intuitionistic logic of proof
assistants: nothing else computes.

\subsection{Weak equivalences}
\label{subsec:weak-equivalences}

\begin{definition}\label[definition]{def:fiber}
	Given a function $f:A→B$ and point $b:B$, the \define{fiber of $f$ above $b$}
  is the type
  \begin{equation*}
    \∑{a:A}{\propeq{}{\apply{f}{a}}{b}}
  \end{equation*}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}\label[definition]{def:weq}
  A function $f:A→B$ is a weak equivalence if any of the following
  equivalent\footnote{For proofs that these characterizations are mutually
    equivalent, see \cite{book}.}
  conditions hold:
  \begin{itemize}
    \itemsep0em
    \item the fibers of $f$ are contractible,
      $\∏{b:B}{\apply{\isContr}{\apply{\ttfun{fiber}_f}{b}}}$
    \item TODO
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{notation}\label[notation]{notation:weq-coerce}
  We may treat a weak equivalence as if it were a function and apply it to an
  argument. This amounts to implicitly applying $\pr{1}$.
\end{notation}

\begin{lemma}\label[lemma]{lemma:contr-weq-unit}
	Any contractible type is weakly equivalent to $\unittype$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Suppose $X:\universe$ is contractible with center $x$. Define $f:X→\unittype$
  as $\λ{x}{\unitelem}$ and $g:\unittype→X$ as $\λ{u}{x}$. Then by hypothesis on
  $X$, the induction principle for $\unittype$\TODO{reference}, and function
  extensionality (\cref{thm:funext}), the composites are the appropriate
  identities.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label[lemma]{lemma:weq-eq}
  If $A,B:\universe$, $w:\weq{A}{B}$, and $x,y:A$ then
  \begin{equation*}
    \weq{(\propeq{B}{\apply{w}{x}}{\apply{w}{y}})}{(\propeq{A}{x}{y})}
  \end{equation*}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}[Proof sketch]
  If $p:\propeq{A}{x}{y}$, then
  $\ap{w}{p}:\propeq{B}{\apply{w}{x}}{\apply{w}{y}}$. Conversely,
  suppose $\propeq{B}{\apply{w}{x}}{\apply{w}{y}}$.
  Then $x$ and $y$ are both in the fiber above $\apply{w}{x}$,
  and since the fibers of a weak equivalence are contractible, $x=y$.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}\label[corollary]{cor:weq-contr}
	If $w:\weq{A}{B}$ and $B$ is contractible, so is $A$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
  By contractibility of $B$, 
  $\propeq{B}{\apply{w}{x}}{\apply{w}{y}}$ for any $a,a':A$, so $A$
  is a mere proposition. Additionally, $w$ has an inverse which sends the center
  $b$ of $B$ to some point $\apply{w^{-1}}{b}$, so $A$ is inhabited.
  Thus, $A$ is contractible.\TODO{reference}
\end{proof}

The following restates the η-rule for the product type as a weak equivalence:

\begin{lemma}\label[lemma]{lemma:paths-dirprod-weq}
  For any $A,B:\universe$, $a:A$, $b:B$, and $x:A×B$,
  \begin{equation*}
    \weq{\big((\propeq{A}{\appr1{x}}{a})×(\propeq{B}{\appr1{x}}{b})\big)}
        {\big(\propeq{}{x}{(a,b)}\big)}
  \end{equation*}
\end{lemma}

\subsection{The univalence axiom}
\label{subsec:the-univalence-axiom}

\begin{definition}\label[definition]{def:ua}
  \TODO{definintion}
  It has the following computation rule:

  Note that this rule holds up to \textit{propositional equality}. This is
  because in \UTT{}, univalence is indeed an \textit{axiom}. It has
  no computational meaning. \TODO{mention CTT}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Function extensionality]\label[theorem]{thm:funext}
	Under the hypothesis of the univalence axiom, function extensionality holds,
  i.e.\ there is a term
  \begin{equation*}\label{eq:funext}
    \funext:\∏{A,B\:\universe}{(\homot{f}{g})\to \propeq{}{f}{g}}
  \end{equation*}
\end{theorem}

As a simple example of the use of univalence, we can vastly generaize
\cref{lemma:contr-weq}.

\begin{theorem}
	Weak equivalences preserve hlevels.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Let $A,B:\universe$, $w:\weq{A}{B}$, and $i:\appply{\hlevel}{n}{A}$.
	Univalence provides an equality $\apply{\ua}{w}:\propeq{\universe}{A}{B}$. 
  Then
  \begin{equation*}
    \transport{\λ{X}{\apply{\isContr}{X}}}{\apply{\ua}{w}}{i} : \appply{\hlevel}{n}{A}
  \end{equation*}
\end{proof}

This argument isn't actually specific to contractibility; using univalence any
proposition of the form ``If $\weq{A}{B}$ and $\apply{P}{A}$, then $\apply{P}{B}$''
trivially true.

\chapter{Category theory}
\label{chap:category-theory}

Category theory presents a challange to set-theoretic mathematicians: the
canonical example of a category is $\Set$, the collection of all sets. In
\ZFC+\FOL, this category is undefinable\footnote{In
  particular, its formation is prevented by the axiom of regularity
  \cite{vonneumann}, which was included in \ZFC to avoid the
  paradoxes of Burali-Forti and Russell. The discovery of said paradoxes
  motivated Bertrand Russell to invent something he called the ``theory of
  types'' \cite{russell}.}.
\Crefrange{sec:basics}{sec:functors-and-their-algebras},
are willfully imprecise, we work with an abstract and undefined notion of
``collection'', and adopt set-theoretic notation. See any textbook on category
theory for information on how problems of size are dealt with set-theoretically.
We will examine category theory within \UTT{} in
\cref{sec:type-theoretic-category-theory}.

The results in this chapter all appear in the \UniMath{} package
\unimathname{CategoryTheory}, so that prefix is left off
(e.g.\ \unimathname{CategoryTheory.limits.binproducts} is shortened to
\unimathname{limits.binproducts}).

\section{Basics}
\label{sec:basics}


\TODO{Type theory and category theory are intimately connected via the
      discipline of \textit{topos theory}}%\index{Topos theory}.}

\begin{definition}\label[category]{def:category}
	A \define{category}\index{Category}\footnote{In more general contexts, this
    may be called a \define{$1$-category} or even a $(1,1)$-category.}
  $\bfC$ consists of the following data:
  \begin{itemize}
    \itemsep-0.2em
    \item a collection of \define{objects}, denoted $\Obj \bfC$,
    \item for each pair of objects $A,B\in\Obj \bfC$, a collection of
      \define{arrows} (or \define{morphisms}) between them, denoted
        $\Hom_{\bfC}(A,B)$,
    \item for each object $A\in\Obj \bfC$, a distinguished arrow
      $\id_A\in\Hom_{\bfC}(A,A)$ called the
      \define{identity}\index{Identity!Morphism}, and
    \item for each triple of objects $A,B,C\in\Obj\bfC$, an operation \\
      $∘:\Hom_{\bfC}(B,C)\times\Hom_{\bfC}(A,B)\to\Hom_{\bfC}(A,C)$ called
      \define{composition}\index{Composition!In a category}.
  \end{itemize}
  These data are subject to the following axioms:
  \begin{enumerate}%[label=\Alph*.]
    \itemsep-0.2em
    \item composition is associative, and
    \item the identity acts as a unit for composition.
  \end{enumerate}
  When the category in question is clear from context, one writes $f:A\to B$ for
  $f\in\Hom_{\bfC}(A,B)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}\label[definition]{def:domain-and-codomain}
  If $f\in\Hom_{\bfC}(A,B)$, then $A$ is the \define{domain}\index{Domain} or
  \define{source}\index{Source} of $f$ and $B$ is the
  \define{codomain}\index{Codomain} or \define{target}\index{Target} of $f$.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
  A student of mathematics will be familiar with the following categories:
  \begin{itemize}
    \itemsep-0.2em
    \item $\Set$: The category with sets as objects, functions as morphisms,
      the usual composition of functions, and identity functions.
    \item $\FinSet$: The category with finite sets as objects, functions as
      morphisms, the usual composition of functions, and identity functions.
    \item $\Grp$: The category of groups\index{Group} with group homomorphisms
      as morphisms. Note that the identity function of sets is the required
      identity morphism and that for any homomorphsisms $ϕ:G\to H$ and

  $f\in\Hom_{\bfC}(A,B)$ such that there exists an arrow $g\in\Hom_{\bfC}(B,A)$

\begin{definition}\label[definition]{def:commutative-diagram}
  A commutative diagram is a way to visualize equations between arrows
  involving composition. Technically a diagram in $\bfC$ is a directed graph
  with vertices labeled by $\Obj\bfC$. If $e$ is an edge from $A$ to $B$, then it
  is labeled by an arrow in $\Hom_\bfC(A,B)$. A diagram \define{commutes}, or is
  commutative, if the composition of the arrows labeling the edges of any two
  directed paths with the same endpoints are equal.

	If $f\in\Hom_{\bfC}(A,B)$, $g\in\Hom_{\bfC}(B,C)$, $h\in\Hom_{\bfC}(A,C)$,

\begin{lemma}\label[lemma]{lemma:terminal-unique}
  Terminal objects are unique up to a specified isomorphism.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Suppose $A$ and $B$ are terminal objects.
  There are unique arrows $f:A\to B$ and $g:B\to A$.
  Then $g∘ f:A\to A$ and $f∘ g:B\to B$, but as per

\begin{lemma}
	(Co)products are unique up to a specified isomorphism.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Note that for any coproduct $C$ of $A$ and $B$, the identity makes the
  following diagram ($⋆$) commute, and so is necessarily unique in doing so:
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzcd}[sep=large,ampersand replacement=\&]
      A \arrow[r, "i_1"{name=I1}]\arrow[dr, swap, "i_1"{name=F}]
      \& C \arrow[d,"\id_C"]
      \& B\arrow[l, "i_2"{name=I2},swap]\arrow[dl,"i_2"{name=G}] \\
      {} \& C \& {}
    \end{tikzcd}
  \end{center}
	Suppose $C$ and $D$ are coproducts of $A$ and $B$. The universal
  property of the coproduct induces arrows $u$ and $u'$ making the following
  diagram commute:
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzcd}[column sep=large,ampersand replacement=\&]
      {} \& C \arrow[dd, dashed, "u", bend left] \& {} \\
      A \arrow[ur]\arrow[dr]

      \& B\arrow[ul]\arrow[dl] \\
      {} \& D \arrow[uu, dashed, "u'", bend left] \& {}
    \end{tikzcd}
  \end{center}
  However by this commutativity, the compositions $u∘u'$ and $u'∘u$ fit into the
  diagram ($⋆$), and so must be the respective identities, making $C$ and $D$
  isomorphic.

          $P\coloneqq \braces{(a,b)∈A×B:\apply{f}{a}=\apply{g}{b}}$; 
          the maps $P→A$ and $P→B$ are just the projections.

          Let $A,B,C$ be sets $f:C→A$, and $g:C→B$.
          The pushout of $f$ and $g$ is the disjoint union quotiented by the
          smallest equivalence relation containing 
          $(0,\apply{f}{c})∼(1,\apply{g}{c})$; the maps $p_1$ and $p_2$ are the
          projections to equivalence classes.

        \itemsep-0.1em
        \item{} \vspace{-0.6em} Let $A,B,C:\universe$, $f:A→C$, and $g:B→C$.
          The pullback of $f$ and $g$ is the type 
          $\∑{a:A}{\∑{b:B} \apply{f}{a}=\apply{g}{b}}$,
          the functions $P→A$ and $P→B$ are just the projections.
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{example}

\begin{example}\label[example]{ex:pullback-special-cases-set}
	The pullback and pushout are complex; it is less immediately clear where they
  arise in standard mathematics than, say, the product and coproduct.
  Three special cases of the pullback in $\Set$ help motivate these constructions.

  \begin{enumerate}%[label=\Alph*.]
    \itemsep-0.2em
    \item A pullback where one of $A$ or $B$ is the terminal object in a 
      category defines the notion of a ``fiber''. Consider the pullback $P$ in
      the following square (where $\braces{∗}$ is any one-point set, a terminal
      object):
      \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzcd}[sep=large]
          P \arrow[r, "p_2"] \arrow[d, "!"] & B \arrow[d, "g"] \\
          \braces{∗} \arrow[r, swap, "f"] & C
        \end{tikzcd}
      \end{center}
      The arrow $f$ picks out a single element of $C$, namely $\apply{f}{∗}∈C$.
      Call this $c$. Since the square commutes, we have $f∘!=g∘p_2$, that is,
      $\apply{(g∘p_2)}{x}=c$ for all $x∈P$. By the explicit
      construction of \cref{ex:pullback-and-pushout},
      \begin{equation*}
          P= \braces{(∗,b)∈\braces{∗}×B:\apply{f}{∗}=\apply{g}{b}}
           ≅ \braces{b∈B:c=\apply{g}{b}}.
      \end{equation*}
      This says that $P$ is (isomorphic to) the \define{fiber of $g$ above $c$}.
    \item More generally, we can consider the \define{inverse image} of a subset
      $S⊆C$. Again, let $B$ and $C$ be arbitrary sets and let $f:B→C$.
      Let $i:S↣C$ be the inclusion function. Then the pullback of $i$ and
      $f$ is
      \begin{align*}
        P&=\braces{(s,b)∈S×B:\apply{i}{s}=\apply{f}{b}} \\
         &=\braces{(s,b)∈S×B:s=\apply{f}{b}} \\
         &≅\braces{b∈B:\apply{f}{b}∈S},
      \end{align*}
      which is the inverse image of $S$ under $f$, denoted
      $\apply{f^{-1}}{V}$.\footnote{The notation
        $f^{-1}$ generalizes the notation for the inverse of a function.
        We can consider $f^{-1}$ to be a function $C→\caP(A)$ into the powerset---
        the set of all subsets---of $A$. In the case that $f$ is bijective,
        it sends each $c∈C$ to a singleton, and defines a function $C→A$,
        also denoted $f^{-1}$.}
    \item Let $S,R⊆C$. The pullback of the inclusions $i:S↣C$ and $j:R↣C$ is
      (isomorphic to) the \define{intersection} $S∩R$:
      \begin{align*}
        P&=\braces{(s,r)∈S×R:\apply{i}{s}=\apply{j}{r}} \\
         &=\braces{(s,r)∈S×R:s=r} \\
         &≅\braces{c∈C:c∈S\text{ and }c∈R} \\
         &=S∩R
      \end{align*}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{example}

\begin{example}\label[example]{ex:pushout-special-cases-top}
  In $\Top$, the wedge sum $A∨B$ is an instance of a pushout.
  Suppose $a∈A$ and $b∈B$ are the basepoints to be ``glued''.
  Define (necessarily continuous) functions
  \begin{align*}
    \begin{split}
      f:\braces{∗}&\longrightarrow A \\
      ∗&\longmapsto a
    \end{split}
    \begin{split}
      g:\braces{∗}&\longrightarrow B \\
      ∗&\longmapsto b
    \end{split}
  \end{align*}
  The equivalence relation $∼$ only relates $\apply{f}{∗}$ and 
  $\apply{g}{∗}$, that is $a∼b$. Thus,
  \begin{equation*}
    A+_{[f,g]}B 
    = A+B/(\apply{f}{∗}∼\apply{g}{∗})
    = A+B/(a∼b)
    = A∨B
  \end{equation*}
\end{example}

\Cref{def:terminal-and-initial}, \cref{def:product-and-coproduct},
\cref{equalizer-and-coequalizer}, and \cref{def:pullback-and-pushout}
are all instances of a general construction of \textit{limits} and
\textit{colimits}. Some preliminary constructions are necessary before these
definitions; these will help make sense of the terms ``candidate \_'' and
``candidate co\_'' used above.

These concepts can be defined in greater generality using
functors (\cref{def:functor}); here we consider only limits over graphs.

\begin{definition}\label[definition]{def:graph-diagram}
	A \define{graph}\index{Graph} $G$ consists of a (not necessarily finite)
  collection $G_0$ of vertices, and a map $G_1:G_0×G_0→\universe$ which assigns
  to each ordered pair of vertices a collection of directed edges between
  them.\footnote{This definition may seem obtuse to a classically-trained
    mathematician, but it translates more elegantly into the type-theoretic
    setting.}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  A \define{diagram}\index{Diagram} $D$ for a graph $G$ is a collection
  of objects and arrows ``of shape $G$''. Specifically, $D$ consists of a map
  $D_0:G_0→\Obj\bfC$ and for each pair $(u,v)$ of vertices in $G_0$,
  a map $D_{1}^{(u,v)}:G_1(u,v)→\Hom(\apply{D_0}{u},\apply{D}_0{v})$.
  When convenient, we drop the sub- and super-scripts.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}\label[definition]{def:cone-cocone}
  Let $D$ be a diagram in $\bfC$ for a graph $G$.
  \vspace{-0.3em}\dual{
    A \define{cone}\index{Cone} for $D$ consists of an object $C\in\Obj\bfC$

    commutes for all $u,v∈G_0$ and $e∈G_1(u,v)$:

  }
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
  A cone for a diagram of shape $·\;·$
  picks out a ``candidate product'' in $\bfC$. Similarly, we can draw the
  following correspondences:

    a \define{limit}\index{Limit} of $D$ consists of a cone $(L,\braces{p_v})$

  If $(L,f_u)$ is a cone or cocone, $L$ is the \define{tip} of the cone.
  If $\bfC$ has a (co)limit for a diagram $D$, its tip is denoted
  $\apply{\Lim}{D}$ (resp.\ $\apply{\Colim}{D}$).
  The collection of cones over a diagram $D$ with tip $X$ is denoted
  $\appply{\Cone}{D}{X}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}\label[remark]{rmk:limit-colimit-universal-adj}
  If $D$ is a diagram in $\bfC$, the above universal properties define
  bijections
  \begin{align*}
    \Hom(A,\apply{\Lim}{D}) &≅ \appply{\Cone}{D}{A}\text{ and} \\
    \Hom(\apply{\Colim}{D},A) &≅ \appply{\Cocone}{D}{A}.
  \end{align*}
  for any object $A$. Again, with one additional criterion (called
  ``naturality''), this can be taken as a alternative definitions.
  (Compare to \cref{rmk:prod-coprod-universal-adj}).
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}\label[definition]{def:complete-and-cocomplete}
  A category $\bfC$ \define{has (co)limits of shape $G$} any diagram of shape
  $G$ has a (co)limit in $\bfC$. A category is \define{(co)complete} or
  \define{has small (co)limits} when it has (co)limits of every shape.
\end{definition}

Generally, one often says $\bfC$ ``has $x$'' for some object $x$ and
collection of arrows defined by a universal property, e.g.\
``$\bfC$ has (binary) products'' or ``$\bfC$ has internal homs''
(\cref{def:exponentials}).


\section{Functors and their algebras}
\label{sec:functors-and-their-algebras}

\begin{definition}\label[definition]{def:functor}
	A \define{functor}\index{Functor} $F$ between categories $\bfC$ and $\bfD$
  consists of the following data:
  \begin{itemize}
    \itemsep-0.2em
    \item a map $F_0:\Obj \bfC\to\Obj \bfD$, and
    \item for each pair of objects $A,B\in\Obj C$, a map \\
      $F_1:\Hom_{\bfC}(A,B) \to\Hom_{\bfD}(F_0(A),F_0(B))$.
  \end{itemize}
  These data are subject to the following axioms:
  \begin{enumerate}%[label=\Alph*.]
    \itemsep-0.2em
    \item functors preserve composition
    \item $F(\id_A)=\id_{F(A)}$ for all $A\in\Obj C$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

We generally leave off the subscripts and parentheses when possible, denoting
the application by simply $FA$ or $Ff$. A functor $F$ from $\bfC$ to
$\bfD$ may be denoted $F:\bfC\to\bfD$. We may define functors without names
using the following notation:
\begin{align*}
  \bfC &⟶ \bfD \\
  A    &⟼_0 \ldots \\
  f    &⟼_1 \ldots
\end{align*}

\begin{example}\label[example]{ex:identity-functor-cat}
  For any category $\bfC$, there is an \define{identity
  functor}\index{Identity!Functor} $\id_{\bfC}\bfC\to\bfC$ which acts as the
  identity on objects and morphisms. The composition of functors is associative,
  and there is a category $\Cat$ of ``small'' categories (it doesn't include
  itself, for instance).
\end{example}

\begin{example}\label[example]{ex:diagonal}
  There is a product in $\Cat$; the product $\bfC×\bfD$ has as object pairs of
  objects $(A,B)$ for $A∈\bfC$ and $B∈\bfD$ and similarly for arrows.
  For any category, there is a \define{diagonal functor}
  \begin{align*}
    Δ:\bfC &⟶ \bfC×\bfC \\
    A    &⟼_0 (A,A) \\
    f    &⟼_1 (f,f)
  \end{align*}
\end{example}

\begin{example}\label[example]{ex:forget}
  For each category of algebraic objects where the morphisms are the
  corresponding type of homomorphism, there is a \define{forgetful functor},
  generally denoted $U$, which takes sets with some structure to their
  underlying sets and homomorphisms to the corresponding maps of sets. For
  instance, there is a forgetful functor $U:\Grp\to\Set$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}\label[example]{ex:coproduct-functoriality}
	If $\bfC$ has binary coproducts, then
  for any fixed $A,B\in\Obj\bfC$, one can define the following
  functors:
  \begin{align*}
    \begin{split}
      \bfC &⟶ \bfC \\
      X    &⟼_0 A + X \\
      f    &⟼_1 \id_A+f = [i_1, i_2∘ f]
    \end{split}
    \begin{split}
      \bfC &⟶ \bfC \\
      Y    &⟼_0 Y + B \\
      g    &⟼_1 g+\id_B = [i_1∘ g, i_2]
    \end{split}
  \end{align*}
  These two functors interact well, meaning in part that they extend to
  a \define{bifunctor}
  \begin{align*}
    \begin{split}
      \bfC×\bfC &⟶ \bfC \\
      (X,Y)    &⟼_0 X + Y \\
      (f,g)    &⟼_1 f+g
    \end{split}
  \end{align*}
  where $(f+g)∘\inl=f$ and $(f+g)∘\inr=g$.
\end{example}

Since functors preserve sources, targets, and composition, they preserve
commutative diagrams. If $f,g,h$ form a commutative triangle in $\bfC$, then
their images under $F:\bfC\to\bfD$ do in $\bfD$:
\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzcd}[column sep=large]
    A\arrow[dr, "f"]\arrow[dd, "h"]\arrow[rr,mapsto,"F"] & {} & F A
    \arrow[dr, "F f"] \arrow[dd, near start, "F h", crossing over] & {} \\
    {} & B\arrow[dl, "g"]\arrow[rr,near start, mapsto, "F", crossing over] & {}
    & F B \arrow[dl, "F g"]\\
    C \arrow[rr,mapsto,"F"]& {} & F C &  {}
  \end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
Note however that it is possible that $FA=FB=FC$, as in a functor to a category
with a single object. However, the equalties between composites still hold.
One consequence is that functors preserve isomorphism.

\begin{definition}\label[definition]{def:endofunctor}
	An \define{endofunctor}\index{Functor!Endofunctor} is a functor with identical
  domain and codomain.
\end{definition}

Endofunctors provide a concise way to encapsulate a
\define{signature}\index{Signature}, a way of describing an object of a
category together with some arrows into it. Signatures are a basic structure
of universal algebra, the zoomed-out study of algebraic structure (as opposed to
algebra, the study of specific algebraic structures e.g.\ monoids, posets,
lattices, rings).

\begin{definition}\label[definition]{def:f-coalgebra}
  \
  \vspace{-0.3em}\dual{
    An \define{algebra}\index{(Co)algebra for a functor} for an endofunctor
    $F:\bfC\to\bfC$ (also called an $F$\define{-algebra}) is a pair
    $(A,α)$ of an object $A\in\Obj\bfC$ and an arrow $α:FA\to A$.
  }{
    A \define{coalgebra} for an endofunctor
    $F:\bfC\to\bfC$ (also called an $F$\define{-coalgebra}) is a pair
    $(A,α)$ of an object $A\in\Obj\bfC$ and an arrow $α:A\to FA$
    \cite{category-theory-for-computing-science}.
  }
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}\label[remark]{rmk:universal-algebra}
  By the universal property of coproducts, an algebra for a functor of the form
  $A↦(A×A)+A+1$ consists of:
  \begin{itemize}
    \itemsep0em
    \item an arrow $A×A→A$ (a binary operation on $A$),
    \item an arrow $A→A$ (a unary operation on $A$),
    \item and a distinguished element $1→A$.
  \end{itemize}
  This is exactly the signature of a \define{group}\index{Group} (the arrow
  $A×A→A$ corresponds the group operation, $A→A$ to inversion, and $1→A$ to the
  identity).

  There is an unfortunate profusion of terms in mathematics using ``algebra'' in
  their name. Functor algebras are unrelated to elementary algebra (the
  solution of equations with unknowns). Their relation to
  algebraic structures like groups is a bit more complex.

  Not every algebra for the above functor will be a group. The functor doesn't
  encode the \textit{equational laws}, e.g.\ that the operation $A×A→A$ is
  associative. To represent such relations, one needs the richer
  structure of a \define{monad}\indeX{Monad}. Monads also have algebras, and it
  is difficult to say whether these generalize $F$-algebras or the other way
  around. Particular groups, rings, algebras over a field, etc.\
  are examples of $F$-algebras (for various choices of $F$), but the definition
  of a $F$-algebra don't encode sufficient information such that
  \textit{every} $F$-algebra for the ``group signature functor'' is indeed a
  group.
\end{remark}

For the remainder of this section when a definition or result is presented only
for coalgebras or algebras, it holds dually for the other.

\begin{definition}\label[definition]{def:coalgebra-morphism}
  A \define{coalgebra morphism}\index{(Co)algebra morphism} from
  $(A,α)$ to $(B,β)$ is an arrow $f:A\to B$ such that the following
  diagram commutes:
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzcd}
      A  \arrow[d, "α"] \arrow[r, "f"] & B \arrow[d, "β"] \\
      FA \arrow[r, "Ff"] & FB
    \end{tikzcd}
  \end{center}
\end{definition}

Since $F$ is a functor, the composition of coalgebra morphisms is again a
coalgebra morphism. In fact, $F$-coalgebras have all of the structure of a
category, which we will call $F\Coalg$.\TODO{Proof?}

\begin{definition}\label[definition]{def:initial-alg}
  \
  \vspace{-0.3em}\dual{
    An \define{initial $F$-algebra}\index{Initial algebra} is an initial
    object of $F\Alg$.
  }{
    An \define{terminal $F$-coalgebra}\index{Terminal coalgebra} is a terminal
    object of $F\Coalg$ (these are more commonly known as
    \define{final coalgebras in the computer science literature}).
  }
\end{definition}

The following example is crucial to
\cref{chap:coinductive-types-in-univalent-type-theory}.

\begin{example}[\unimathname{FunctorAlgebras.Nats}]\label[example]{ex:nat}
  Let $\bfC$ be a category with distinguished binary coproducts and a terminal
  object $1$. Consider the functor
  \begin{align*}
    F:\bfC &⟶ \bfC  \\
    A &⟼_0 1+A \\
    f &⟼_1 \id_1+f
  \end{align*}
  where 1 is a terminal object\index{Terminal object} and $+$ is the coproduct
  bifunctor as in \cref{ex:coproduct-functoriality}. Let's examine
  what it \textit{means} for some $F$-algebra $(N,η)$ to be initial. By
  composing with the coproduct\index{Coproduct!In category theory} injections,
  we can define
  \begin{align*}
    \begin{split}
      z &: 1 ⟶ N \\
      z &= η∘ i_1
    \end{split}
    \begin{split}
      s &: 1 ⟶ N \\
      s &= η∘ i_2
    \end{split}
  \end{align*}
  so that $η=[z,s]$:
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzcd}[sep=large,ampersand replacement=\&]
      1 \arrow[r, "i_1"{name=I1}]\arrow[dr, swap, "z"{name=F}]

      {} \& N \& {}
    \end{tikzcd}
  \end{center}
  Suppose we have another $F$-algebra $(A,α)$, and we define $f,g$ by
  composition as above so that $α=[f,g]$. By initiality of $(N,η)$,
  there is a unique arrow $u$ making the following diagram commute:
  \newcommand{\eeeeeta}{[z,s]}
  \newcommand{\aaaaalpha}{[f,g]}
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzcd}[sep=large]
      1+N \arrow[r, dashed, "\id_1+u"]\arrow[d, "\eeeeeta"] & 1+A\arrow[d, "\aaaaalpha"]  \\
      N \arrow[r, dashed, "u"] & A
    \end{tikzcd}
  \end{center}
  By functoriality of the coproduct (\cref{ex:coproduct-functoriality}), we can
  compose along either the left- or right-hand paths in the above diagram.
  The above square states $u∘ [z,s]= [f,g]∘ (\id_1+u)$. Precomposing
  with $i_1:1\to 1+N$ yields
  \begin{align*}
    u∘ z = u∘ [z,s]∘ i_1
    &= [f,g]∘ (\id_1+u) ∘ i_1
    && \text{Above diagram} \\
    &= [f,g]∘ [i_1,i_2∘ u] ∘ i_1
    && \text{Definition of }+ \\
    &= [f, g]∘ i_1 \\
    &= f
  \end{align*}
  By similar reasoning, precomposing with $i_2$ yields
  \begin{equation*}
    u∘ s = u∘ [z,s] ∘ i_2
    = [f,g]∘(\id_1+u)∘ i_2
    = g∘ u.
  \end{equation*}
  Combining the above two equations, we have the following universal property
  for $(N,η)$. For any object $A$ with arrows $f:1\to A$ and $g:A\to A$,
  there is a unique arrow $u:N\to A$ making the following diagram commute:
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzcd}[sep=large]
      1
        \arrow[r, "z"]
        \arrow[dr, swap, "f"]
        & N \arrow[r, "s"] \arrow[d, "u", dashed]
        & N \arrow[d, "u", dashed] \\
      {}
      & A \arrow[r, "g"]
      & A
    \end{tikzcd}
  \end{center}
  Well, we've successfully rephrased the property of initiality, but it seems
  just as cryptic now as it was then. Let's see if we can figure out what an
  type with this property would look like in our favorite category \universe, the
  universe of small types in \UTT!

  Let \List{\N} be the type of lists of natural numbers
  as in \cref{subsubsec:lists}. To utilize the above property, we need
  to choose $A$, $f$, and $g$. Pick the following:
  \begin{itemize}
    \itemsep0em
    \item $A:\equiv \List{\N}$
    \item $f:\equiv \λ{x}{\nil}$
    \item $g:\equiv \λ{l}{\cons(5,l)}$
  \end{itemize}
  From the universal property of $(N,[z,s])$, we get a function
  $u:N\to \List{A}$ such that
  \begin{align*}
    u(z) = \nil
    &&\text{and}&&
    u(s(n)) = \cons(5, u(n))
  \end{align*}
  Look familiar yet? Indeed, one type with such a property is $\N$! In that
  case, $u$ is the function that, when given a number $n$, outputs a list of $5$s
  with length $n$.\footnote{In $\Set$, $\N$ would be an initial algebra.
    It makes sense to ask if this functor has an initial algebra in any
    category with a terminal object and binary coproducts, and in
    general, such algebras are called \define{natural number objects} (NNOs)
    \cite{sketches} \cite{lawvere-etcs}.
  }
\end{example}

\begin{example}\label[example]{ex:final-coalgebra}
  A coalgebra for this same functor $A↦A+1$ is a set $A$ with a partial unary
  operation (where the value $1$ represents failure/undefined).
  In $\universe$ the type $\N_∞\jdeq\N+\unittype$ is the carrier of a final
  coalgebra given by a partial operation
  \begin{alignat*}{3}
    &\ttfun{pred} : \N+\unittype &&\to(\N+\unittype)+\unittype \\
    &\ttfun{pred}(\apinl{0})                 &&\jdeq \apinr{(\apinr{\unitelem})}
      &\qquad\quad&\text{(undefined)}\\
    &\ttfun{pred}(\apinl{(\apply{\suc}{n})}) &&\jdeq n
      &\qquad\quad& \\
    &\ttfun{pred}(\apinr{\unitelem})         &&\jdeq \apinr{\unitelem}
      &\qquad\quad&\text{($\apinr{\unitelem}$ is like $∞$)}
  \end{alignat*}
  which acts like the natural numbers with an extra ``infinite element''
  \cite{adamek}.
\end{example}

	Fascinatingly, the closed real interval can be understood as a final
  coalgebra \cite{freyd}. \TODO{}

  \begin{itemize}
    \itemsep0em
    \item An initial algebra for the functor $A↦B×A+1$ has the universal property
      of a \define{list object}.

      the induction principle for binary trees.

\section{Type theoretic category theory}
\label{sec:type-theoretic-category-theory}

Unfortunately, terminology varies between the three predominant sources
on category theory in univalent type theory \cite{book} \cite{unimath}
\cite{hott-lib}.

For a pioneering development of univalent category theory, see \cite{rezk} (the
formalization of which served as a foundation for \UniMath{}'s
\unimathname{CategoryTheory} package). See also Chapter 9 of \cite{book}.

Types in \UTT{} are the analogues of sets in \ZFC{}+\FOL{}, insofar as they also
represent ``collections''. Therefore, a naïve translation of the definition
would define a category to consist of a type $C:\universe$ of objects and a
family $\ttHom_{C}:C→C→\universe$ of arrows.

\subsection{Basics}
\label{subsec:basics}

\begin{definition}\label[definition]{def:precategory}
  A \define{precategory}\index{Precategory} consists of the following data:
  \begin{itemize}
    \itemsep-0.2em
    \item a type $\bfC:\universe$ of \define{objects},
    \item a family $\ttHom_{\bfC}:\bfC→\bfC→\universe$ which assigns to each pair
      of types a \define{hom-type} which has \define{morphisms} as its elements, 
    \item a map $\id:\∏{c:\bfC}{\appply{\ttHom_{\bfC}}{c}{c}}$
      which assigns to each object an 
      \define{identity morphism}\index{Identity!Morphism},
    \item an operation
      \begin{equation*}
        ∘:\∏{a,b,c:\bfC}{\appply{\ttHom_{\bfC}}{b}{c}→\appply{\ttHom_{\bfC}}{a}{b}→\appply{\ttHom_{\bfC}}{a}{c}}
      \end{equation*}
      called \define{composition}\index{Composition!In a precategory}, and
  \end{itemize}
  together with maps witnessing\footnote{This is an expressly type-theoretic
    presentation; one might instead use the more classical ``for all objects
    $a,b$ of $\bfC$ and arrows $f:A$''. However, since such definitions appear
    in the previous chapter, these are phrased more idiosyncratically to help the
    reader get used to this more rigid formalism.} the following axioms:
  \begin{enumerate}%[label=\Alph*.]
    \itemsep-0.2em
    \item left and right identity:
      \begin{align*}
        \∏{a,b:\bfC}{\∏{f:\appply{\ttHom_{\bfC}}{a}{b}}{&\id_B∘f=f}} \\
        \∏{a,b:\bfC}{\∏{f:\appply{\ttHom_{\bfC}}{a}{b}}{&f∘\id_A=f}}
      \end{align*}
    \item associativity of composition:
      \begin{equation*}
        \∏{a,b,c,d:\bfC}{
          \∏{f:\appply{\ttHom_{\bfC}}{a}{b}}{
            \∏{g:\appply{\ttHom_{\bfC}}{b}{c}}{
              \∏{h:\appply{\ttHom_{\bfC}}{c}{d}}{
                \propeq{}{(h∘g)∘f}{h∘(g∘f)}
        }}}}
      \end{equation*}
  \end{enumerate} 
  We denote arrows $\appply{\ttHom}{a}{b}$ by $a\rightharpoonup b$ in an attempt
  to distinguish it from the function type $a→b$. 
  The type of all precategories is denoted $\Precat$.
\end{definition}

Many concepts from classical category theory can be translated with no further
thought into the language of precategories. 

\begin{definition}\label[definition]{def:functor-tt}
	A \define{functor}\index{Functor} $F$ between $\bfC,\bfD:\Precat$
  consists of the following data:
  \begin{itemize}
    \itemsep-0.2em
    \item a map $F_0:\bfC\to\bfD$ and
    \item a map
      $F_1:\∏{a,b:\bfC}{\appply{\Hom_{\bfD}}{(\apply{F_0}{a})}{(\apply{F_0}{b})}}$
  \end{itemize}
  together with maps witnessing the following axioms:
  \begin{enumerate}%[label=\Alph*.]
    \itemsep-0.2em
    \item preservation of identity:
      \begin{equation*}
        \∏{a:\bfC}{\apply{F_1}{\id_A}=\id_{(\apply{F_0}{A})}}
      \end{equation*}
    \item preservation of composition:
      \begin{equation*}
        \∏{a,b,c:\bfC}{
          \∏{f:\appply{\ttHom_{\bfC}}{a}{b}}{
            \∏{g:\appply{\ttHom_{\bfC}}{b}{c}}{
              \propeq{}{\apply{F_1}{(g∘f)}}{\apply{F_1}{g}∘\apply{F_1}{f}}
        }}}.
      \end{equation*}
  \end{enumerate}
  The type of functors from $\bfC$ to $\bfD$ is denoted
  $\appply{\Functor}{\bfC}{\bfD}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}[\coqname{CategoryTheory.categories.Cats.precat\_precat},
                \\ \coqname{CategoryTheory.categories.Cats.cat\_precat}]
  \label[example]{ex:precat-of-precats}
  There is a precategory of precategories, with object type
  $\Precat$ and morphism type 
  $\ttfun{Functor}$;\footnote{This is a great example of how universes deal
    elegantly with problems of size: this precategory isn't a member of itself,
    because it is really only a precategory of $\universei{i}$-small
    precategories for fixed $i$, and itself is an element of 
    $\universei{\apply{\suc}{i}}$.}
  there is also a precategory with object type $\ttfun{Category}$.
\end{example}

Many such ``translated'' definitions are so near to the originals that we won't
treat them here (e.g.\ commutative diagrams, isomorphisms, and the specific
kinds of (co)limits).

However, when proving analogous results about such constructions in
precategories, one soon runs into difficulty. The
root of the problem is that the hom-types may have ``higher homotopical
structure'', and to account for this structure would require infinitely many
additional axioms.\footnote{The precise nature of this structure and how it
  interferes with classical intuitions is outside the scope of this thesis,
  though certain instructional difficulties will arise in
  \cref{chap:coinductive-types-in-univalent-type-theory} (indeed, that whole
  chapter may be seen as an attempt to use 1-category theoretic-intuitions
  outside their domain of applicability).} For most applications, it suffices 
to restrict the hom-types to be hom-sets:
\begin{definition}\label[definition]{def:category-tt}
  A precategory $\bfC$ \define{has hom-sets}\index{Having hom-sets} if the type
  \begin{equation*}
    \pit{a,b:\bfC}{\apply{\isSet}{(\appply{\ttHom}{a}{b})}}
  \end{equation*}
  is inhabited. A precategory with hom-sets is called a \define{category}.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Products in $\universe$}
\label{subsec:products-in-universe}

In \cref{chap:coinductive-types-in-univalent-type-theory}, we will be most
concerned with a precategory that is emphatically \textit{not} a category,
namely $\universe$. In particular, M-types are constructed as limits
in $\universe$. The next few lemmas explore binary products before defining and
constructing general limits in \cref{subsec:limits-in-universe}.

\begin{lemma}[\unimathname{categories.Types.BinProductsType}]
  \label[lemma]{lemma:universe-binproducts}
	The precategory of types has binary
  products.\footnote{Again, where these are defined by rote translation from
    \cref{def:product-and-coproduct}.}
\end{lemma}

While there are more direct proofs, the following is based on the
observation made in \cref{rmk:prod-coprod-universal-adj}, and will carry over to
the case of general limits. We begin a general lemma:

\begin{lemma}[\unimathname{limits.binproduct.isBinProduct'\_to\_isBinProduct}]
  \label[lemma]{lemma:isbinproduct}
  Let $\bfC$ be a precategory, let $a,b,c:\bfC$, and let $p_1:c\catarrow a$,
  $p_2:c\catarrow b$. Define a function
  \begin{gather*}
    \ttfun{postcomp}:\∏{d:\bfC}{(d\→ c)→ (d \→ a)×(d \→ b)
    } \\
    \appply{\ttfun{postcomp}}{f} \defeq (p_1∘f,p_2∘f)
  \end{gather*}
  If $\ttfun{postcomp}$ is an equivalence, $c$ is a product of $a$ and $b$.
\end{lemma}

\textit{Sketch}. Why is this true? If $\ttfun{postcomp}$ is an equivalence, then
its fibers are contractible. In particular, for each pair of arrows $f:d\→a$ and
$g:d\→b$, there is exactly one arrow $u:d\→c$ in the fiber over them. This means
when $u$ is composed projections $p_1$ and $p_2$, it gives back $f$ and $g$ (up
to propositional equality). This is just a backwards rephrasing of the universal
property of the product.

\begin{proof}
  Fix $d$, $q_1$, and $q_2$ as in the type of $\ttfun{postcomp}$.
  For $(c,p_1,p_2)$ to be a product of $a$ and $b$, the following type must be
  contractible:\TODO{actually just put this in its own definition}
  \begin{equation*}
    \∑{f:d\→c}{(p_1∘f=q_1)×(p_2∘f=q_2)}
  \end{equation*}
  By \cref{cor:weq-contr}, it suffices to show that the above type is equivalent
  to a contractible type. By \cref{def:weq}, the fibers of $\ttfun{postcomp}$
  are contractible, so it suffices to show that the above type is equivalent to
  the fiber over some point in $(d \→ a)×(d \→ b)$. This point is $(q_1,q_2)$:
  \begin{align*}
    \apply{\ttfun{fiber}}{(q_1,q_2)}
    &\≡ \∑{f:d\→c}{\propeq{}{\apply{\ttfun{postcomp}}{f}}{(q_1,q_2)}}
    &&\text{Definition} \\
    &\≡ \∑{f:d\→c}{\propeq{}{(p_1∘f,p_2∘f)}{(q_1,q_2)}}
    &&\text{Definition} \\
    &\≃ \∑{f:d\→c}{(p_1∘f=q_1)×(p_2∘f=q_2)}
    &&\text{\Cref{lemma:paths-dirprod-weq}}
  \end{align*}
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label[lemma]{lemma:voevodsky-prod-up}
	There is an equivalence of types
  \begin{equation*}
    (C→A)×(C→B)≃(C→A×B)
  \end{equation*}
  for all $A,B,C:\universe$.\footnote{This result originally appeared in
    Voevodsky's ``Foundations'' library, a precursor to \UniMath{}.}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Define 
  \begin{gather*}
    g : (C→A)×(C→B) → (C→A×B) \\
    \apply{g}{(h,i)} \defeq \λ{c}{(\apply{h}{c},\apply{i}{c})}
  \end{gather*}
  and let $\ttfun{postcomp}_{\universe}$ be the specialization of 
  $\ttfun{postcomp}$ to the category of types. Then
  \begin{align*}
    \apply{(g∘\ttfun{postcomp}_{\universe})}{h}
    &\≡ \apply{g}{(\pr{1}∘\apply{h},\pr{2}∘\apply{h})} \\
    &\≡ \λ{c}{(\pr{1}∘\apply{h},\pr{2}∘\apply{h})} \\
    &\= h
  \end{align*}
  where the final equality is due to function extensionality (\cref{thm:funext})
  and the η-rule for the product type \TODO{reference}. Further,
  \begin{align*}
    \apply{(\ttfun{postcomp}_{\universe}∘g)}{(h,i)}
    &\≡ \apply{\ttfun{postcomp}_{\universe}}{(\λ{c}{(\apply{h}{c},\apply{i}{c})})} \\
    &\≡ (\pr{1}∘\λ{c}{(\apply{h}{c},\apply{i}{c})},\pr{2}∘\λ{c}{(\apply{h}{c},\apply{i}{c})}) \\
    &\= (h,i)
  \end{align*}
  where the final equality is again due to function extensionality
  and the η-rule for the product type \cref{lemma:paths-dirprod-weq}.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of \cref{lemma:universe-binproducts}]
	\Cref{lemma:voevodsky-prod-up} proves that $\ttfun{postcomp}$ is an
  equivalence in $\universe$, so by \cref{lemma:isbinproduct}, $\universe$ has
  binary products.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Limits in $\universe$}
\label{subsec:limits-in-universe}


\begin{definition}\label[definition]{def:limit-cone}
	A cone $(L,p_u):\appply{\Cone}{D}{L}$ is a \define{limit cone} for a diagram $D$

    \apply{\ttfun{postcomp}}{f} \defeq

  $\apply{D}{e}$ are in fact functions, and so we can apply them.)

\chapter{Coinductive types in univalent type theory}
\label{chap:coinductive-types-in-univalent-type-theory}

The results in this chapter all appear in the \UniMath{} package
\unimathname{Induction}, so that prefix is left off
(e.g.\ \unimathname{Induction.W.Core} is shortened to
\unimathname{W.Core}).

\section{W and M}
\label{sec:w-and-m}

We now present W-types and M-types. Per Martin-Löf introduced W-types as a
way to study types with a well-ordering. In fact, W-types provide a general and
convenient setting for the study of induction. In extensional type theories,
W-types are equivalent to initial algebras (as in \cref{def:initial-alg}) for
polynomial functors (see \cref{def:polynomial-functor}), so all the examples
we've seen so far of inductive types defined as functor algebras are W-types.

Dually, M-types are non-wellfounded trees, that is, trees with potentially
infinitely long branches.

\begin{definition}\label[definition]{def:container}
  A \define{container}\index{Container} (sometimes called a
  \define{signature}\index{Signature} by analogy, see
  \cref{rmk:universal-algebra}) is a pair $(A,B)$ of a type
  $A:\universe$ and a family $B:A→\universe$.
\end{definition}
Given a container, we can form the associated W- and M-types:
\begin{gatherjot}
  \prftree[r]{W-form}
    {Γ ⊢ A:\universe}{Γ ⊢ B:A\to\universe}
    {Γ ⊢ \type{\W{a}{A}{B}}}
  \\
  \prftree[r]{M-form}
    {Γ ⊢ A:\universe}{Γ ⊢ B:A\to\universe}
    {Γ ⊢ \type{\M{a}{A}{B}}}
\end{gatherjot}
Again, these types are shaped like trees. An element of a W-type is specified by
an element $a:A$ (the ``label'' of this vertex) and a function
$b:B(a)\to \W{x}{A}{B(x)}$ which picks out its subtrees.
\begin{equation*}
  \prftree[r]{W-intro}
    {Γ ⊢ A:\universe}{Γ ⊢ B:A\to\universe}{Γ ⊢ a:A}{Γ ⊢ b:B(a)\to \W{x}{A}{B}}
    {Γ ⊢ \sup{a}{b}:\W{x}{A}{B}}
\end{equation*}
Martin-Löf points out that a ``bottom'' element can be given by taking one of
the $B(a)$ to be $\emptytype$ and the subtree-function to be the one provided by
$\rec_{\emptytype}$ (example in \cref{ex:nat-w})\TODO{reference}.

The elimination rule\index{Elimination!For W-types} for W-types encodes
transfinite induction. If, when a property $C:\W{a}{A}{B}→\universe$ holds for
all subtrees of a given node it also holds for that node, then it holds for any
element in $\W{a}{A}{B}$:
\begin{equation*}
  \prftree[r]{W-elim}
    {Γ ⊢ w:\W{a}{A}{B}}
    {\prftree[r, noline]{}
      {Γ, a:A,\quad f:\apply{B}{a}→\W{a}{A}{B},\quad g:\∏{b:\apply{B}{a}}{\apply{C}{(\apply{f}{b})}}}
      {⊢\apppply{h}{a}{f}{g}: C(\sup{a}{f})}}
    {Γ ⊢ \appply{\recW}{w}{h}:\apply{C}{w}}
\end{equation*}

\begin{example}\label[example]{ex:nat-w}
  The natural numbers are readily encoded as a W-type.
  Define $B\defeq \apppply{\rec_{\booltype}}{\universe}{\emptytype}{\unittype}$
  so that $\apply{B}{\bfalse}\jdeq \emptytype$ and
  $\apply{B}{\btrue}\jdeq\unittype$, and consider $\N'\jdeq \W{b}{A}{B}$.
  Let $!$ be the unique function out of the empty type and further define:
  \begin{align*}
    \begin{split}
      0_{\N'} &: \W{b}{\booltype}{B} \\
      0_{\N'} &\defeq \sup{\bfalse}{!} \\
    \end{split}
    \begin{split}
      1_{\N'} &: \W{b}{\booltype}{B} \\
      1_{\N'} &\defeq \sup{\btrue}{(\λ{x}{0_{\N'}})}
    \end{split}
  \end{align*}
  Following this pattern, we can define
  \begin{align*}
    \suc &: \N' \to \N' \\
    \suc &\defeq \λ{n}{\sup{\btrue}{(\λ{x}{n})}}
  \end{align*}
  so that $1_{\N'}\equiv \apply{\suc}{0_{\N'}}$. What does this tree look like?
  Well, by virtue of construction, $0_{\N'}$ is its least element. Applying
  $\suc$ gives us an element at one level higher in the tree than the one we put
  in.

      \node     [scale=2, above of=E, color=white] {$\cdots$};

      \draw[->] (A) edge (B);
      \draw[->] (B) edge (C);
      \draw[->] (C) edge (D);
      \draw[->] (D) edge (E);
      % \draw (A) edge [in=-60,out=-20,loop] node[below] {$e$} (A);
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{center}

  We can derive from the induction principle of $\booltype$ that it
  only has two elements, $\bfalse$ and $\btrue$ \TODO{reference}.
  Using this (and ignoring uniquely specified terms like $!$),
  the W-elimination rule for $\N'$ can be reshaped and simplified:
  \begin{equation*}
    \prftree[r]{\N'-elim}
      {Γ ⊢ n:\N'}
      {\prftree[r, noline]{}
        {Γ⊢h_1: C(0_{\N'})}}
      {\prftree[r, noline]{}
        {Γ, f:\unittype→\N',g:\∏{\unitelem:\unittype}\apply{C}{(\apply{f}{\unitelem)}}}
        {⊢\appply{h_2}{f}{g}: C(\sup{\btrue}{f})}}
      {Γ ⊢ \apppply{\rec_{\N'}}{n}{h_1}{h_2}:\apply{C}{n}}
  \end{equation*}
  But since a function $\unittype→\N'$ is equivalent to picking out a single
  element of $\N'$ and $\sup{\btrue}{f}\equiv\apply{\suc}{f}$,
  this is just the elimination rule for the natural numbers (\TODO{ref})
  in disguise.
\end{example}

Other examples include lists, binary trees, ordinals of the second number
class, and more.\TODO{reference} In the next few sections, we will develop a
correspondence between W-types (resp.\ M-types) and initial algebras (resp.\
final coalgebras) for a general class of functor on $\universe$, which will
include all examples in \cref{sec:functors-and-their-algebras}.

\section{Preliminaries}
\label{sec:preliminaries}

\begin{definition}[\unimathname{PolynomialFunctors.polynomial\_functor}]
  \label[definition]{def:polynomial-functor}
  Given a container $S\defeq (A,B)$, its associated \define{polynomial functor}
  is the function
  \begin{gather*}
    P:\universe\to \universe \\
    \apply{P_{A,B}}{X}\defeq\∑{a:A}{B(a)\to X}
  \end{gather*}
  We will regularly leave off the subscript for $P$.
  The \define{action} of $P$ on functions is
  \begin{gather*}
    P^* : (X\to Y)\to P_{A,B}(X)\to P_{A,B}(Y) \\
    \apply{P^*f}{(a,g)}\defeq (a,g∘f).
  \end{gather*}
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
	Technically, polynomial functors aren't functors, since $\universe$ isn't
  a category (the whole point of the univalent perspective is that it behaves
  more like a weak higher category). It has functorial properties only up to
  \textit{propositional} equality (as in \cref{def:functor-tt}), which will
  suffice for the following proofs. That is, we have
  \begin{align*}
    \apply{P^*}{g∘f} = \apply{P^*}{g}∘\apply{P^*}{f}
    &&
    \apply{P^*}{\id_X} = \apply{P^*}{\id_X}
  \end{align*}
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}\label[definition]{def:algebra-coalgebra-in-utt}
  Exactly as in \cref{def:f-coalgebra}, we define the type of (co)algebras for a
  polynomial functor $P$ associated to a container $(A,B)$ as follows:
  \begin{align*}
    \Algtype_P\≔\∑{A:\universe}{PA→A} && \Coalgtype_P\≔\∑{A:\universe}{A→PA}
  \end{align*}
  and coalgebra morphisms as
  \begin{align*}
    \ttfun{CoalgMor}((X,α),(Y,β))
    &\≔ (X,α)⇒(Y,β) \\
    &\≔ \∑{f:X→Y}{(\apply{P}{f})∘α = β∘f}
  \end{align*}
  with algebra morphisms defined dually \cite{homotopy-initial}.
\end{definition}

See \cref{ex:nat-functor-utt} for the polynomial functor for which $\ℕ$ is
initial.

\section{Internalizing M-types}
\label{sec:internalizing-m-types}

Fix a container $S\defeq (A,B)$ and let $P$ be the associated polynomial functor.
We will prove a few auxiliary lemmas on the way to the following result.
This proof appeared in the \Agda{} formalization of \cite{non-wellfounded}, this
is its first appearance ``de-formalized''.

\subsection{Uniqueness}
\label{subsec:uniqueness}

\begin{lemma}[\unimathname{M.Uniqueness.M\_coalg\_eq},
              \unimathname{M.Uniqueness.isaprop\_M}]
  \label[lemma]{lemma:final-colagebra-unique}
  Any two final $P$-coalgebras are equal. In other words, the following type is
  a proposition:
  \begin{equation*}
    \Final(S)\defeq
    \∑{(X,α):\Coalgtype_{S}}{
      \∏{(Y,β):\Coalgtype_{S}}{\isContr((Y,β)⇒ (X,α))}
    }
  \end{equation*}
\end{lemma}

First, we'll show that their carriers are equivalent:

\begin{lemma}[\unimathname{M.Uniqueness.M\_carriers\_iso}]
  \label[lemma]{lemma:algebra-iso-equiv}
	If $(X,α)$ and $(Y,β)$ are final $P$-coalgebras,
  then the first projections of the unique coalgebra morphisms
  $f:X⇒ Y$ and $g:Y⇒ X$ induce
  an equivalence of types $\weq{X}{Y}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  This proof is a standard categorical technique, much reminiscent of
  \cref{lemma:terminal-unique}.
	\TODO{proof}
\end{proof}

We can then invoke the characterization of paths in $Σ$-types,
\cref{lemma:path-sigma}. We'll need to demonstrate that the coalgebra map
$α:X\to FX$ is equal to $β:Y\to FY$ when transported along the path
constructed in \cref{lemma:algebra-iso-equiv}.

\begin{lemma}\label[lemma]{lemma:polynomial-functor-transport}
  For all $X,Y:\universe$, $F:\universe\to\universe$,
  $f:X\to FX$, $g:Y\to FY$, and $p:\propeq{}{X}{Y}$,
  if for all $x:X$ we have
  \begin{equation*}
    \propeq{}{
      \transport{F}{p}{\apply{f}{x}}
    }{
      g({\transport{\id_{\universe}}{p}{x}})
    }
  \end{equation*}
  then $\propeq{}{\transport{Z↦ (Z\to FZ)}{p}{f}}{g}$.
  That is, $f$ is equal to $g$ after being transported just when
  applying $f$ and transporting the result is the same as transporting the
  input and applying $g$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Using identity elimination (\cref{rule:id-elim}), it suffices to assume
  $X\jdeq Y$ and $p\jdeq\refl{X}$. Then by the definition of transport
  (\cref{lemma:transport}), our hypothesis becomes
  \begin{align*}
    &\propeq{}{
      \transport{F}{p}{\apply{f}{x}}
    }{
      g({\transport{\id_{\universe}}{p}{x}})
    } \\
    &\implies
    \propeq{}{
      \transport{F}{\refl{X}}{\apply{f}{x}}
    }{
      g({\transport{\id_{\universe}}{\refl{X}}{x}})
    } \\
    &\implies
    \propeq{}{\apply{f}{x}}{\apply{g}{x}}
  \end{align*}
  so by function extensionality $f=g$. Again by definition of transport,
  $\transport{Z↦ (Z\to FZ)}{\refl{X}}{f} \jdeq f=g$.
\end{proof}

To complete the proof that the transported coalgebra maps are equal, we'll need
the following auxiliary result:

\begin{lemma}\label[lemma]{lemma:polynomial-functor-transport}
  For all $X,Y:\universe$ and $p:\propeq{}{X}{Y}$,
  \begin{equation*}
    \propeq{}{
      P^*\paren{\transpor{\id_{\universe}}{p}}
    }{
      \transpor{P}{p}
    }
  \end{equation*}
  Note that $P^*$ is applied to the function $\transpor{\id_{\universe}}{p}$
  before it gets applied to its second argument.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Note that we're using \cref{notation:transport}. By the elimination rule for
  the identity type, (\cref{rule:id-elim}), it suffices to assume that $X\jdeq
  Y$ and that $p\jdeq\refl{X}$. Then
  \begin{align*}
    P^*\paren*{\transpor{\id_{\universe}}{p}}
    &\jdeq P^*\paren*{\transpor{\id_{\universe}}{\refl{X}}}
    && \text{Identity elim.} \\
    &\jdeq P^*\paren{\id_X}
    && \text{\Cref{lemma:transport}} \\
    &\jdeq \λ{(a,f)}{(a,f∘ \id_X)}
    && \text{\Cref{def:polynomial-functor}} \\
    &\jdeq \λ{(a,f)}{(a,f)} \\
    &\jdeq \id_{PX}
    && \text{\Cref{def:id-polymorphic}} \\
    &\jdeq \transpor{\id_{\universe}}{\refl{PX}}
    && \text{\Cref{lemma:transport}} \\
    &\jdeq \transpor{\id_{\universe}}{\ap{P}{\refl{X}}}
    && \text{\Cref{lemma:ap}} \\
    &\jdeq \transpor{P}{\refl{X}}
    && \text{\Cref{lemma:transport-compose}} \\
    &\jdeq \transpor{P}{p}
    && \text{Identity elim.}
  \end{align*}
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of \cref{lemma:final-colagebra-unique}]
  Let:
  \begin{itemize}
    \itemsep0em
    \item $(X,α)$, $(Y,β)$ be final $P$-coalgebras,
    \item $f:X⇒ Y$ and $g:Y⇒ X$ be the unique $P$-coalgebra
      morphisms between them,
    \item $q:\weq{X}{Y}$ the equivalence of types induced by $f$ and $g$
      (\cref{lemma:algebra-iso-equiv}).
  \end{itemize}
  By univalence, there is a path
    $\apply{\ua}{q}:\propeq{\universe}{X}{Y}$.\footnote{This
    is our first (but not nearly our last) crucial use of univalence. Without an
    equality, we couldn't \transportname{} $α$ to $β$ in the next step.
    This step also demonstrates that function extensionality alone doesn't
    suffice.}
  To demonstrate that $\propeq{}{(X,α)}{(Y,β)}$, we invoke the
  characterization of paths in $Σ$-types, \cref{lemma:path-sigma}. It
  remains to show
  \begin{equation*}
    \propeq{(Y\to PY)}{\transport{Z↦ (Z\to PZ)}{\apply{\ua}{q}}{α}}{β}.
  \end{equation*}
  but by \cref{lemma:polynomial-functor-transport}, it suffices to show that
  for all $x:X$,
  \begin{equation*}
    \propeq{}{
      \transport{P}{\apply{\ua}{q}}{\apply{α}{x}}
    }{
      β(\transport{\id_\universe}{p}{x})
    }.
  \end{equation*}
  % Lemma 2 in HoTT/M-types
  First, note that
  \begin{align*}
    \transpor{P}{\apply{\ua}{q}}
    &= P^*\paren{\transpor{\id_{\universe}}{\apply{\ua}{q}}}
    && \text{\Cref{lemma:polynomial-functor-transport}} \\
    &= P^*q
    && \text{\Cref{def:ua}} \\
    &= P^*(\appr{1}{f})
    && \text{\Cref{lemma:algebra-iso-equiv}}
  \end{align*}
  The last step utilizes the idea of \textit{proof-relevant
    mathematics}. Although we define $q$ within a proof, we can (without
  cheating) refer to its definition from another proof. Also note the
  use of \cref{notation:weq-coerce}. Working from the other side of the
  equation, we can use the computational rule of univalence (\cref{def:ua}):
  \begin{align*}
    β(\transport{\id_\universe}{\apply{\ua}{q}}{x})
    = β(\apply{q}{x})
    = β({\appr{1}{f}}{x})
  \end{align*}
  Thus, we now want to demonstrate that
  \begin{align*}
    P^*(\appr{1}{f})(α x) &=
    \transport{P}{\apply{\ua}{q}}{\apply{α}{x}} \\
    &= β(\transport{\id_\universe}{p}{x}) \\
    &= β({\appr{1}{f}}{x})
  \end{align*}
  However, this is exactly the condition that $f$ is a $P$-coalgebra morphism:
  \TODO{reference definition}
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzcd}[column sep=large]
      X  \arrow[d, "α"] \arrow[r, "\appr{1}{f}"] & Y \arrow[d, "β"] \\
      FX \arrow[r, "P^*(\appr{1}{f})"] & FY
    \end{tikzcd}
  \end{center}
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[\unimathname{W.Uniqueness.W\_alg\_eq},
              \unimathname{W.Uniqueness.isaprop\_W}]
  Any two initial $P$-algebras are equal.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	The above proof works with only minor modifications, see the \Coq{}
  development for details.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Fibered algebras and the natural numbers}
\label{subsec:fibered-algebras}

A functor algebra $\dpair{X}{α}$ has as its first component a type
$X:\universe$. What would it mean for an algebra to be ``fibered'' over this
one, with a first component $Y:X → \universe$? When can a \textit{dependent}
type (over an algebra) can be given the structure of a functor algebra?
Such fibered algebras generalize regular algebras for endofunctors.

The fiber-initial property of $\ℕ$
(see \cref{def:fiber-initiality} and \cref{lemma:fiber-initiality-nat})
is essential to proving a property about limits
(\cref{lemma:cochains}) that plays a pivotal role in the proof of the existence
of M-types.

\begin{definition}[\unimathname{W.Fibered.fibered\_alg},
                   \unimathname{W.Fibered.algebra\_section}]
  \label[definition]{def:algebra-fibration}
  Inspired by the homotopical semantics for \UTT{},
  if $(X,α)$ is an algebra for the functor associated to $(A,B)$,
  the type of \define{fibered $P$-algebras} over $X$ is
  \begin{equation*}
    \Fibalgtype(X)\≔
    \∑{E:X→\universe}
    {\∏{\dpair{x}{h}:P_{A,B}X}{
      \paren{\∏{b:\apply{B}{x}}{\apply{E}{(\apply{h}{b})}}}
      → \apply{E}{(\apply{\alpha}{\dpair{x}{h}})}
    }}
  \end{equation*}
  an \define{algebra fibration}.
  % ((∑ (f : forall x, E x), forall a, f (c a) = e a (f ∘ (pr2 a)))).
  An \define{algebra section} for an algebra fibration $(E,θ)$ is a pair
  \begin{equation*}
    \∑{f:\∏{x:X}{\apply{E}{x}}}
    \∏{x:P_{A,B}X}
    {\propeq
      {}
      % {\∏{x:X}{\apply{E}{(\apply{α}{x})}}}
      {\apply{f}{(\apply{α}{x})}}
      {\appply{θ}{x}{(f∘\appr{2}{x})}}}
  \end{equation*}
\end{definition}

\begin{example}[\unimathname{W.Fibered.alg2fibered\_alg},
                \unimathname{W.Fibered.fibered\_alg2alg}]
  Any $P$-algebra can be made into a fibered $P$-algebra over $(X,α)$ by using a
  constant family:
  \begin{align*}
    \Algtype_P &\longrightarrow \Fibalgtype(X) \\
    \dpair{Y}{β} &\longmapsto
                \dpair{\λ{x}{Y}} {\λ{x}{\λ{f}{\apply{β}{\dpair{\appr{1}{x}}{f}}}}}
  \end{align*}
  Since the $x$ in the argument to the second coordinate is of type
  $P_{A,B}X\jdeq \∑{a:A}\apply{B}{a}→X$ and $f:\apply{B}{(\appr{1}{x})}→Y$, the pair
  $\dpair{x}{f}$ has type $P_{A,B}Y\jdeq \∑{a:A}\apply{B}{a}→Y$, which can then be
  sent via $β$ to $Y$. This matches our expectation that a non-dependent
  $\ttfun{foo}$ should be a generalization of a dependent $\ttfun{foo}$.
  In turn, any fibered algebra with family $E:X→\universe$ can be turned into a
  non-fibered algebra over the ``total space'' $\∑{x:X}\apply{E}{x}$.
\end{example}

\begin{definition}[\unimathname{W.Fibered.is\_preinitial\_sec}]
  \label[definition]{def:fiber-preinitiality}
  An algebra $\dpair{X}{α}$ is \define{fiber-preinitial}
  if for any fibered algebra $\dpair{E}{θ}$ over
  $X$ the type of algebra sections from $X$ to $E$ is
  inhabited.\footnote{\cite{homotopy-initial} call this an ``inductive
  algebra''.\label{fn:inductive-algebra}}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[\unimathname{W.Fibered.fibered\_uniqueness}]
  \label[definition]{def:fiber-uniqueness}
  An algebra $\dpair{X}{α}$ has the \define{fiber uniqueness property}
  if for any fibered algebra $\dpair{E}{θ}$ over
  $X$ the type of algebra sections from $X$ to $E$ is a
  proposition.\footnote{\cite{homotopy-initial} call this the η-rule for
    inductive algebras (see \cref{fn:inductive-algebra}).}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}\label[definition]{def:fiber-initiality}
  Combining \crefrange{def:fiber-preinitiality}{def:fiber-uniqueness}, an
  algebra $\dpair{X}{α}$ is \define{fiber-initial} if the type of algebra
  sections from $X$ to any fibered algebra $\dpair{E}{θ}$ over $X$ is
  contractible.
\end{definition}

\Cref{subsubsec:fibered-natural-numbers} explores the applications of these
functions to $\ℕ$.

\subsubsection{The natural numbers}
\label{subsubsec:fibered-natural-numbers}

We now prove a few facts about the natural numbers and the functor for which
they are initial, some of which will be familiar from
\cref{sec:functors-and-their-algebras}.\footnote{These arguments are my own,
  though some of these theorems are proved in the \Agda development of
  \cite{non-wellfounded}.}

\begin{example}[\coqname{W.Naturals.nat\_functor}]
  \label[example]{ex:nat-functor-utt}
	Consider the polynomial functor associated to $A\defeq \𝔹$ and
  $B\defeq \apppply{\rec_{\𝔹}}{\universe}{\𝟘}{\𝟙}$:
  \begin{equation*}
    PX \defeq \∑{b:\𝔹}{\appppply{\rec_{\𝔹}}{\universe}{\𝟘}{\𝟙}{b}} → X.
  \end{equation*}
  An algebra for this functor is given by a type $X:\universe$ and a function
  \begin{equation*}
    PX → X\≡ \paren{\∑{b:\𝔹}{\appppply{\rec_{\𝔹}}{\universe}{\𝟘}{\𝟙}{b}} → X} → X
  \end{equation*}
  Define:
  \begin{align*}
    &η : Pℕ → ℕ &&\\
    &\apply{η}{\dpair{\bfalse}{g}} \defeq 0
    &&\quad(\text{In this case,  }g:\𝟘 → X) \\
    &\apply{η}{\dpair{\btrue}{g}}  \defeq \apply{\suc}{(\apply{g}{\unitelem})}
    &&\quad(\text{In this case,  }g:\𝟙 → X) \\
  \end{align*}
\end{example}

While the above polynomial functor $P$ bears some relation to the definition of
$ℕ$ as an W-type (\cref{ex:nat-w}), it is not immediately clear that this is the
correct definition, nor how we can apply our intuition about $\ℕ$ to this
situation. The next lemma provides more evidence that $P$ is an analogue
of $X ↦ 1 + X$.

\begin{lemma}[\coqname{W.Naturals.nat\_functor\_equiv}]
  \label[lemma]{lemma:nat-alg-simpl}
  A $P$-algebra structure on a type $X$ is given by a point $x_0:X$ and a
  function $\suc_x:X→X$. More precisely, there is an equivalence:
  \begin{equation*}
    w:\weq{\Algtype_P}{\∑{X:\universe}{X × (X → X)}}
  \end{equation*}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Suppose given a $P$-algebra $(X,α)$. Then define
  \begin{align*}
    \begin{split}
      x_0 &: X \\
      x_0 &\defeq \apply{α}{\dpair{\bfalse}{\apply{\rec_{\𝟘}}{X}}} \\
    \end{split}
    \begin{split}
      \suc_X  &: X → X \\
      \suc_X  &\defeq \λ{x}{\apply{α}{\dpair{\btrue}{\appply{\rec_{\𝟙}}{X}{x}}}}
    \end{split}
  \end{align*}
  Now $\dpair{X}{(x_0,\suc_X)}$ has type $\∑{X:\universe}{X × (X → X)}$ as
  desired.

  In the other direction, suppose we have some type $X$, a point $x_0:X$, and a
  function $\suc_X:X → X$. Define
  \begin{align*}
    &α:\paren{\∑{b:\𝔹}{\appppply{\rec_{\𝔹}}{\universe}{\𝟘}{\𝟙}{b}} → X} → X \\
    &\apply{α}{\dpair{\bfalse}{h}} \defeq x_0 \\
    &\apply{α}{\dpair{\btrue}{h}}  \defeq \apply{\suc_X}{(\apply{h}{\unitelem})}
  \end{align*}
  While it's not immediately that these functions are inverses, it follows from
  initiality of $\emptytype$ in $\universe$ and the contractibility of
  $\unittype$, both of which will be used extensively in the next few proofs.
\end{proof}

Applying this equivalence, we could more readily define the $P$-algebra over
$\ℕ$ as $(\appply{w}{0}{\suc})$. In fact, this gives \textit{judgmentally equal}
result. We can give a similar lemma for morphisms:

\begin{lemma}[\coqname{W.Naturals.mk\_nat\_functor\_algebra\_mor}]
  \label[lemma]{lemma:mk-nat-alg-mor}
  Let $\dpair{X}{α}$ and $\dpair{Y}{β}$ be $P$-algebras. Any function $f:X → Y$
  which sends $x_0$ to $y_0$ and intertwines $\suc_X$ with $\suc_Y$ is an
  algebra morphism.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	To show that $f$ is an algebra morphism (\cref{def:algebra-coalgebra-in-utt}),
  we must demonstrate that the following diagram commutes:
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzcd}
      PX  \arrow[d, "α"] \arrow[r, "P^*f"] & PY \arrow[d, "β"] \\
      X \arrow[r, "f"] & Y
    \end{tikzcd}
  \end{center}
  where $\apply{P^*f}{\dpair{b}{h}}\defeq \dpair{b}{f ∘ h}$
  (\cref{def:polynomial-functor}).
  By function extensionality (\cref{thm:funext}), it suffices to show that the
  two composites are equal on all inputs. Let $\dpair{b}{h}:PX$, and proceed by
  cases on $b:\𝔹$.

  If $b\≡\bfalse$, then $h:\𝟘 → X$. Recall that $\emptytype$ is terminal in
  $\universe$; the type of functions $\𝟘 → Z$ is contractible for any
  $Z:\universe$. Thus,
  \begin{align*}
    \apply{(β∘(P^*f))}{\dpair{\bfalse}{h}}
    &\jdeq \apply{β}{\dpair{\bfalse}{f ∘ h}} \\
    &= \apply{β}{\dpair{\bfalse}{\apply{\rec_{\𝟘}}{Y}}}
    &&\quad\text{Terminality of }\𝟘\\
    &\jdeq y_0
    &&\quad\text{Definition} \\
    &= \apply{f}{x_0}
    &&\quad\text{Hypothesis} \\
    &\jdeq \apply{(f∘α)}{\dpair{\bfalse}{\apply{\rec_{\𝟘}}{X}}} \\
    &= \apply{(f∘α)}{\dpair{\bfalse}{h}}
    &&\quad\text{Terminality of }\𝟘
  \end{align*}

  If $b\≡\btrue$, then $h:\𝟙 → X$. By the induction principle for
  $\𝟙$\TODO{reference}, for any type $Z:\universe$, any function $k:\𝟙 → Z$, and
  any $x:\𝟙$, $\apply{k}{x}=\apply{k}{\unitelem}$. In short,
  $k=\appply{\rec_{\𝟙}}{Z}{(\apply{k}{\unitelem})}$. In this case,
  \begin{align*}
    \apply{(β∘(P^*f))}{\dpair{\btrue}{h}}
    &\jdeq \apply{β}{\dpair{\btrue}{f ∘ h}} \\
    &\= \apply{β}{\dpair{\btrue}{f ∘ (\appply{\rec_{\𝟙}}{Y}{(\apply{h}{\unitelem})})}} \\
    &\= \apply{β}{\dpair{\btrue}{\appply{\rec_{\𝟙}}{Y}{(\apply{f}{(\apply{h}{\unitelem})})}}}
    &&\quad\text{Function ext.} \\
    &\jdeq \apply{\suc_Y}{(\apply{f}{(\apply{h}{\unitelem})})}
    &&\quad\text{Definition of }\suc_Y \\
    &\= \apply{f}{(\apply{\suc_X}{(\apply{h}{\unitelem})})}
    &&\quad\text{Hypothesis} \\
    &\jdeq \apply{f}{(\apply{α}{\dpair{\btrue}{\fromunit{X}{(\apply{h}{\unitelem})}}})}

\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[\coqname{W.Naturals.nat\_alg\_is\_preinitial}]
	For any $P$-algebra $\dpair{X}{α}$, there is an algebra morphism
  $\dpair{ℕ}{η} ⇒ \dpair{X}{α}$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Define $x_0$ and $\suc_X$ as in the above proof.
  Now define a function $g$ recursively:
  \begin{alignat*}{2}
    &g : ℕ → X \\
    &\apply{g}{0}                 &&\defeq x_0 \\
    &\apply{g}{(\apply{\suc}{n})} &&\defeq \suc_X(g(n))
  \end{alignat*}
  By definition $g$ sends the distinguished point $x_0$ to $0$ and intertwines
  $\suc$ with $\suc_X$; by \cref{lemma:nat-alg-mor}, it's an algebra morphism.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}[\coqname{W.Naturals.nat\_alg\_func\_is\_unique}]
  \label[lemma]{lemma:nat-alg-mor-fun-unique}
  The underlying function of the above morphism is unique. That is,
	for any algebra morphism $\dpair{τ}{i}:\dpair{ℕ}{η} ⇒ \dpair{X}{α}$,
  $\propeq{}{τ}{g}$, with $g$ as in the previous proof.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  By function extensionality (\cref{thm:funext}), it suffices to show that they
  are equal on all inputs. We know that the following diagrams commute:
  \begin{center}
    \begin{minipage}[b]{0.48\linewidth}
      \centering
      \begin{tikzcd}
        P\ℕ  \arrow[d, "η"] \arrow[r, "P^*g"] & PX \arrow[d, "α"] \\
        \ℕ \arrow[r, "g"] & X
      \end{tikzcd}
    \end{minipage}
    \begin{minipage}[b]{0.48\linewidth}
      \centering
      \begin{tikzcd}
        P\ℕ  \arrow[d, "η"] \arrow[r, "P^*τ"] & PX \arrow[d, "α"] \\
        \ℕ \arrow[r, "τ"] & X
      \end{tikzcd}
    \end{minipage}
  \end{center}
  Using function extensionality, proceed
  by induction on the argument.
  % by cases on the constructor of the argument.

  % mor 0 =
  % (x ∘ polynomial_functor_arr bool (bool_rect (λ _ : bool, UU) ∅ unit) mor)
  %   (true,, fromempty)
  (Base case) In the zero case, we have
  $\dpair{\bfalse}{\apply{\rec_{\𝟘}}{\ℕ}}:P\ℕ$. Then
  % By definition of $η$ and the
  % commuting condition for $τ$ (in the diagram above),
  \begin{align*}
    \apply{τ}{0}
    &= \apply{τ}{(\apply{η}{\dpair{\bfalse}{\apply{\rec_{\𝟘}}{\ℕ}}})}
    &&\quad\text{Definition of }η \\
    &\jdeq \apply{(τ∘η)}{\dpair{\bfalse}{\apply{\rec_{\𝟘}}{\ℕ}}} \\
    &= \apply{(α∘P^*τ)}{\dpair{\bfalse}{\apply{\rec_{\𝟘}}{\ℕ}}}
    &&\quad\text{Commuting condition} \\
    &\jdeq \apply{α}{\dpair{\bfalse}{τ∘\apply{\rec_{\𝟘}}{\ℕ}}}
    &&\quad\text{Definition of }P^* \\
    &= \apply{α}{\dpair{\bfalse}{\apply{\rec_{\𝟘}}{X}}}
    &&\quad\text{Contractibility of }\𝟘 → X\\
    &\jdeq x_0 \\
    &\jdeq \apply{g}{0}.
  \end{align*}

  % (false,, (λ _ : bool_rect (λ _ : bool, UU) ∅ unit false, n0))
  (Inductive step) Suppose the hypothesis holds for $n:\ℕ$. Then
  $\dpair{\btrue}{\apply{\rec_{\𝟙}}{\ℕ}{n}}:P\ℕ$.
  Recall the definition of $f$ given in the previous proof. Similarly to the
  above reasoning,
  \begin{align*}
    \apply{τ}{(\apply{\suc}{n})}
    &= \apply{τ}{(\apply{η}{\dpair{\btrue}{\appply{\rec_{\𝟙}}{\ℕ}{n}}})}
    &&\quad\text{Definition of }η \\
    &\jdeq \apply{(τ∘η)}{\dpair{\btrue}{\appply{\rec_{\𝟙}}{\ℕ}{n}}} \\
    &= \apply{(α∘P^*τ)}{\dpair{\btrue}{\appply{\rec_{\𝟙}}{\ℕ}{n}}}
    &&\quad\text{Commuting condition} \\
    &\jdeq \apply{α}{\dpair{\btrue}{τ∘\appply{\rec_{\𝟙}}{\ℕ}{n}}}
    &&\quad\text{Definition of }P^* \\
    &= \apply{α}{\dpair{\btrue}{\appply{\rec_{\𝟙}}{X}{(\apply{τ}{n}})}} \\
    &\jdeq \apply{\suc_X}{(\apply{τ}{n})} \\
    &= \apply{\suc_X}{(\apply{g}{n})}
    &&\quad\text{Inductive hypothesis} \\
    &\jdeq \apply{g}{(\apply{\suc}{n})}.
    &&\quad\text{Definition of }g
  \end{align*}
\end{proof}

Similar to the result of \cref{lemma:nat-alg-simpl}, fibered algebras over $\ℕ$
also have a simple structure understood by an equivalence.

\begin{lemma}[\coqname{W.Naturals.fibered\_algebra\_nat}]
  \label[lemma]{lemma:nat-fib-alg-simpl}
  A fibered algebra structure (over $\ℕ$) on a family
  $E:\ℕ\to\universe$ is given by a point $e_0:E_0$
  and a family of functions $f^E:\pit{n:\ℕ}{E_n\to E_{n+1}}$. Specifically,
  there is an equivalence
  \begin{equation*}
    \weq{\Fibalgtype(\dpair{ℕ}{\suc})}
        {\∑{E:\universe}E_0×\pit{n:\ℕ}{E_n\to E_{n+1}}}
  \end{equation*}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	\TODO{proof?}
\end{proof}

And like \cref{lemma:mk-nat-alg-mor}, we can also simplify our understanding of
algebra sections.

\begin{lemma}[\coqname{W.Naturals.mk\_nat\_alg\_sec}]
  \label[lemma]{lemma:mk-nat-alg-sec}
  % (p1 : x 0 = pr1 (pr2 FA'))
  % (p2 : (∏ n, pr2 (pr2 FA') n (x n) = x (S n))),
  Let $\dpair{E}{θ}$ be a fibered $P$-algebra over $\dpair{\ℕ}{\suc}$.
  If $x:\∏{n:\ℕ}{X}$ sends $0$ to $e_0$ and for all $n$,
  $\propeq{}{\apply{f^E}{n}}{\apply{x}{(\apply{\suc}{n})}}$,
  then there is a corresponding algebra section with $x$ as the underlying
  function.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	\TODO{proof?}
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label[lemma]{lemma:nat-alg-sec-equiv}
  The above function is an equivalence.
\end{lemma}

This result is proved in the \Agda{} formalization accompanying
\cite{non-wellfounded}. Its proof is outside of the scope

\begin{lemma}[\coqname{W.Naturals.nat\_alg\_is\_preinitial\_sec}]
  \label[lemma]{lemma:fiber-preinitiality-nat}
	The natural numbers are fiber-preinitial (\cref{def:fiber-preinitiality}).
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Suppose $\dpair{E}{θ}$ is a fibered algebra over $\ℕ$
  (\cref{def:algebra-fibration}) so that $E:\ℕ→\universe$ and
  \begin{equation*}
    θ:\∏{\dpair{n}{h}:P\ℕ}{\paren{\∏{b:\appppply{\rec_{\𝟚}}{\universe}{\𝟘}{\𝟙}{n}}{\apply{E}{(\apply{h}{b})}}} → \apply{E}{(\apply{η}{\dpair{n}{h}})}}.
  \end{equation*}
  The first part of an algebra section is a function $f:\∏{n:\ℕ}{\apply{E}{n}}$.
  Define $f$ by induction:
  \begin{alignat*}{2}
    &f : \∏{n:\ℕ}{\apply{E}{n}}   &&\\
    &\apply{f}{0}                 &&\defeq
    \appply{θ}{\dpair{\bfalse}{\fromempty{ℕ}}}
              {(\fromempty{(E∘\fromempty{\ℕ})})} \\
    &\apply{f}{(\apply{\suc}{n})} &&\defeq
    \appply{θ}{\dpair{\btrue}{\appply{\rec_{\𝟙}}{\ℕ}{n}}}
              {(\fromunit{(\apply{E}{n})}{(\apply{f}{n})})}
  \end{alignat*}
  Let $\dpair{b}{h}:P_{A,B}\ℕ$. It remains to show that this function is indeed
  a section, namely that
  \begin{equation*}
    \propeq
      {}
      {\apply{f}{(\apply{η}{\dpair{b}{h}})}}
      {\appply{θ}{\dpair{b}{h}}{(f∘h)}}
  \end{equation*}
  Proceed by cases on $b$.

  If $b\≡\bfalse$, then $h:\𝟘 → ℕ$. In this case,
  \begin{align*}
    \apply{f}{(\apply{η}{\dpair{\bfalse}{h}})}
    &\≡ \apply{f}{0}
    &&\quad\text{Definition of }η \\
    &\≡ \appply{θ}{\dpair{\bfalse}{\fromempty{ℕ}}}
                  {(\fromempty{(E∘\fromempty{\ℕ})})}
    &&\quad\text{Definition of }f \\
    &\= \appply{θ}{\dpair{\bfalse}{h}}{(f∘h)}
  \end{align*}
  by the contractibility of types $\𝟘 → \ℕ$ and
  $(E∘\fromempty{\ℕ}) → \ℕ$.\TODO{reference}

  If $b\≡\btrue$, then $h:\𝟙 → ℕ$.
  \begin{align*}
    \apply{f}{(\apply{η}{\dpair{\btrue}{h}})}
    &\≡ \apply{f}{(\apply{\suc}{(\apply{h}{\unitelem})})} \\
    &\≡ \appply{θ}{\dpair{\btrue}{\appply{\rec_{\𝟙}}{\ℕ}{(\apply{h}{\unitelem})}}}
                  {\Big(\fromunit{(\apply{E}{(\apply{h}{\unitelem})})}
                             {(\apply{f}{(\apply{h}{\unitelem})})}\Big)} \\
    &\= \appply{θ}{\dpair{\btrue}{h}}{(f∘h)}
  \end{align*}
  where the last equality is by two applications of function extensionality
  (\cref{thm:funext}) and the contractibility for $\𝟙$.
\end{proof}

	The natural numbers are fiber-initial (\cref{def:fiber-initiality}).

% \begin{lemma}\label[lemma]{lemma:algebra-sections}
%   Let $X$ be a $P$-algebra with $α:PX→X$, and let $C:X→\universe$. The standard

%   if $\∑{x:X}{Cx}$ also has a $P$-algebra structure, as in

%       X \arrow[ur, "s"] \arrow[r, equal] & X
%     \end{tikzcd}
%   \end{center}
%   In this case, $s$ is a $P$-algebra morphism \cite{inductive}.
% \end{lemma}

\subsection{Limits}
\label{subsec:limits}

In extensional type theories, W-types can be derived as colimits of
\define{chains}, which are given by a family $X:\ℕ → \universe$ and a family of
functions $π_n:X_{n+1}\to X_n$.\TODO{do they use cochains?} Dually,
M-types can be constructed as limits of such chains. As noted in
\cite{non-wellfounded}, these types are instances
of the general homotopy limits of \cite{homotopy-limits}.

\begin{definition}\label[definition]{def:limitt}
	Given chain $X:\N\to\universe$ and $π_n:X_{n+1}\to X_n$, the \define{limit} of
  $(X,π)$ is the type
  \begin{equation*}
    L(X,π)\defeq \∑{x:\∏{n:\N}{X_n}}{\∏{n:\N}π_nx_{n+1}=x_n}
  \end{equation*}
  We give special names to the projection maps for limits: $p \defeq \pr{1}$ and
  $β \defeq \pr{2}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}\label[lemma]{lemma:limitt-universal}
	There is an equivalence of types
  \begin{equation*}
    \weq{(A\to L(X,π))}{\∑{f:\∏{n:\N}A\to X_n}{\∏{n:\N}{\propeq{}{π_n∘ f_{n+1}}{f_n}}}}
  \end{equation*}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	To give an equivalence, it suffices to give functions back and forth that
  compose to the respective identities.\TODO{reference definition}
  First, define
  \begin{gather*}
    ϕ :(A\to L(X,π)) ⟶ \∑{f:\∏{n:\N}A\to X_n}{\∏{n:\N}{\propeq{}{π_n∘ f_{n+1}}{f_n}}} \\
    ϕ(g) \defeq
    \dpair{\λ{n}\λ{a}\appply{p}{(\apply{g}{a})}{n}}
          {\λ{n}\appply{β}{(\apply{g}{a})}{n})}
  \intertext{and}
    ψ : \paren*[\bigg]{\∑{f:\∏{n:\N}A\to X_n}{\∏{n:\N}{π_n∘ f_{n+1}=f_n}}}
          \to A\to L(X,π) \\
    ψ((f; h)) \defeq \λ{a:A} \dpair{\λ{n}\appply{f}{n}{a}}{h}
  \end{gather*}
  Their composites are judgmentally equal to the appropriate identities.
  \TODO{should I include proof?}
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label[lemma]{lemma:cochains}
	If $X:\N\to\universe$ is a family of types, $ρ:\∏{n:\N}{X_n\to X_{n+1}}$ is a
  family of functions, and
  \begin{equation*}
    Z\defeq \∑{x:\∏{n:\N}X_n}{\∏{n:\N}x_{n+1}=ρ_n(x_n)},
  \end{equation*}
  then $\weq{Z}{X_0}$, that is, limits of cochains are entirely determined by
  the first element.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Consider again the functor of \cref{ex:nat}, specialized to the case of
  $\bfC\≔\universe$:
  \begin{gather*}
    G:\universe ⟶ \universe  \\
    G(W) \defeq 1+W
  \end{gather*}
  A $G$-algebra is given by a type $W:\universe$, a point in $W$, and a function
  $W\to W$. Fix a point $z:Z$. Then $\appr{1}{z}$ gives a point in
  $\∏{n:\ℕ}{\apply{X}{n}}$.
