  abstract="When Kant introduced his well-known distinction between analytic and synthetic judgements, he was well aware that it was not something entirely new. In the Prolegomena, he gives an explicit and very detailed reference to Locke, reproaching his dogmatic predecessors Wolff and Baumgarten for having neglected it, and one may take more or less for granted that he knew the Leibnizian distinction between truths of reason and truths of fact, although, strangely enough, he never gives, as far as I know, an explicit reference to it. Also, we know of the Humean distinction between relations of ideas and matters of fact, which is of course even verbally very close to the Leibnizian distinction. Kant's own terminology was that of analytic versus synthetic judgements. After Kant, we also find the distinction treated by Bolzano, for instance, who spoke about conceptual and intuitional propositions, Ger. Begrifjs-and Anschauungss{\"a}tze, respectively. With Bolzano, the situation is a bit strange in comparison with Kant, because he had not only the distinction between conceptual and intuitional propositions, but he also had the distinction between analytic and synthetic propositions.",

  abstract = {The Univalent Foundations (UF) offer a new picture of the foundations of mathematics largely independent from set theory. In this paper I will focus on the question of whether Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT) (as a formalization of UF) can be justified intuitively as a theory of shapes in the same way that ZFC (as a formalization of set-theoretic foundations) can be justified intuitively as a theory of collections. I first clarify what I mean by an ?intuitive justification? by distinguishing between formal and pre- formal ?meaning explanations? in the vein of Martin-Lo?f. I then explain why Martin-Lo?f?s original meaning explanation for type theory no longer applies to HoTT. Finally, I outline a pre-formal meaning explanation for HoTT based on spatial notions like ?shape?, ?path?, ?point? etc. which in particular provides an intuitive justification of the axiom of univalence. I conclude by discussing the limitations and prospects of such a project.}
