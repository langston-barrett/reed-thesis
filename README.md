# Undergraduate Thesis

<!-- [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/siddharthist/reed-thesis.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/siddharthist/reed-thesis) -->

This repo holds my undergraduate thesis (completed in May 2018), which focused
on adding "internal" M-types to the
[UniMath](https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath) library. See this paper for details:
["Non-wellfounded Trees in Homotopy Type Theory"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.02949).

## Directory Structure

 - `archive/` contains things I thought I would need, but didn't.
 - `coq/` contains formalized mathematics
    * `coq/Exercises` contains solutions to exercises in the HoTT book.
 - `exercises/` contains informal solutions to exercises in various texts
    * `exercises/hott*`: From the HoTT book (scanned from handwritten versions)
    * `exercises/hatcher*`: From Hatcher's Algebraic Topology
    * `exercises/awodey*`: From Awodey's Category Theory
 - `notes/` contains LaTeX notes on various subjects at the level of detail I required at the time (no attempt to be comprehensive nor expository has been made).
    * `notes/hott-figures` is a bunch of Tikz drawings corresponding to lemmas and theorems in the HoTT book
 - `tex-preamble/` is a collection of LaTeX files that are useful to `\input{}` at the beginning of documents.
